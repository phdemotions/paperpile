                  people’s fingertips, giving them immediate access to more
                  music than ever before. Here we overcome limitations of prior
                  research by leveraging ecologically valid streaming data: 17.6
                  million songs and over 662,000 hr of music listened to by
                  5,808 Spotify users spanning a 3-month period. Building on
                  interactionist theories, we investigated the link between
                  personality traits and music listening behavior, described by
                  an extensive set of 211 mood, genre, demographic, and
                  behavioral metrics. Findings from machine learning showed that
                  the Big Five personality traits are predicted by musical
                  preferences and habitual listening behaviors with moderate to
                  high accuracy. Importantly, our work contrasts a recent
                  self-report-based meta-analysis, which suggested that
                  personality traits play only a small role in musical
                  preferences; rather, we show with big data and advanced
                  machine learning methods that personality is indeed important
                  and warrants continued rigorous investigation.},

                  like medical results or job offers. During such uncertain
                  waiting periods, there is uncertainty around an outcome that
                  people have minimal control over. Uncertainty makes these
                  periods emotionally challenging, raising the possibility that
                  emotion regulation strategies may have different effects while
                  people wait for an uncertain outcome versus after they learn
                  that outcome. To test this possibility, we conducted secondary
                  analyses of an experience sampling study following 101 Belgian
                  University students for 9 days as they waited for (uncertain
                  period), and then received (certain period), consequential
                  exam grades. Across 8,275 observations, we tested the effects
                  of six emotion regulation strategies on positive and negative
                  emotions about anticipated, and then actual, grades.
                  Regardless of uncertainty, acceptance was consistently
                  beneficial for short-term emotional well-being, and expressive
                  suppression was consistently detrimental. However, the
                  consequences of rumination, social sharing, and reappraisal
                  differed when the outcome was uncertain versus certain.
                  Rumination was more detrimental to short-term emotional
                  well-being during the uncertain than certain period, while
                  social sharing and reappraisal were detrimental in the
                  uncertain period but beneficial in the certain period. These
                  findings suggest uncertainty moderates the short-term
                  effectiveness of some emotion regulation strategies in an
                  academic context, which may exacerbate the emotional
                  challenges of uncertain waiting periods. (PsycInfo Database

  abstract     = {Agency (A) and communion (C) are fundamental content
                  dimensions. We propose a facet-model that differentiates A
                  into assertiveness (AA) and competence (AC) and C into warmth
                  (CW) and morality (CM). We tested the model in a
                  cross-cultural study by comparing data from Asia, Australia,
                  Europe, and the USA (overall N = 1.808). Exploratory and
                  confirmatory factor analyses supported our model. Both the
                  two-factor model and the four-factor model showed good fit
                  indices across countries. Participants answered additional
                  measures intended to demonstrate the fruitfulness of
                  distinguishing the facets. The findings support the model's
                  construct validity by positioning the fundamental dimensions
                  and their facets within a network of self-construal, values,
                  impression management, and the Big Five personality factors:
                  In all countries, A was related to independent self-construal
                  and to agentic values, C was related to interdependent
                  self-construal and to communal values. Regarding the facets,
                  AA was always related to A values, but the association of AC
                  with A values fell below our effect size criterion in four of
                  the five countries. A (both AA and AC) was related to agentic
                  impression management. However, C (both CW and CM) was neither
                  related to communal nor to agentic impression management.
                  Regarding the Big Five personality factors, A was related to
                  emotional stability, to extraversion, and to
                  conscientiousness. C was related to agreeableness and to
                  extraversion. AA was more strongly related to emotional
                  stability and extraversion than AC. CW was more strongly
                  related to extraversion and agreeableness than CM. We could
                  also show that self-esteem was more related to AA than AC; and
                  that it was related to CM, but not to CW. Our research shows
                  that (a) the fundamental dimensions of A and C are stable
                  across cultures; and (b) that the here proposed distinction of
                  facets of A and C is fruitful in analyzing self-perception.
                  The here proposed measure, the AC-IN, may be a useful tool in
                  this research area. Applications of the facet model in social
                  perception research are discussed.},

                  capture the unique historical and cultural context that could
                  affect perceptions of Asian American individuals. We have
                  identified a more differentiated underlying structure with
                  four dimensions—warmth, competence, self-centeredness, and
                  submissiveness—that differ in their rated typicality and
                  desirability for Asian and White Americans. We then developed
                  the 16-item Asian American Stereotypes Scale to measure
                  perceptions of Asian Americans on these four dimensions.
                  Ratings on the different dimensions predict unique variance in

                  contact with Asians or Asian Americans, perceptions of size of

                  studies (N = 789) using both university and community samples
                  examined the relationship between live music events and CE and
                  how this relationship contributes to positive, lasting
                  outcomes. Results suggest that CE is highly related to
                  positive outcomes associated with attending live music events.
                  CE uniquely predicted meaning in life and enjoyment during the
                  event above and beyond related constructs. Feeling CE was also
                  related to greater meaning in life during the event and
                  continued happiness a week after live music events. Further,

                  events (e.g., parasocial bonds with the artist) and positive

                  shift on brand loyalty, conclusions from the existing
                  marketing literature have been inconsistent. Drawing on the
                  distinctions between online and offline shopping, the authors
                  develop a theoretical framework that focuses on uncertainty
                  avoidance (UA) to reconcile the inconsistencies in the
                  literature. Specifically, the authors argue that high-UA (vs.
                  low-UA) individuals are more (vs. less) brand loyal when
                  shopping online than when shopping offline because the product
                  experience is less predictable in the former (vs. latter), a
                  distinction between online and offline shopping that increases
                  (reduces) high-UA (low-UA) individuals’ tendency to stay with

                  attenuates the interplay between online (vs. offline) shopping
                  and UA. Across eight studies that consist of secondary data,
                  field studies, and online and laboratory experiments, the

                  theory regarding the interconnectedness of the mind and body,
                  which we term mind-body correspondence (MBC), predicts
                  engagement in health behaviors. Specifically, we hypothesised
                  that MBC would strengthen mind influences the body (MIB) and
                  body influences the mind (BIM) beliefs, which would in turn
                  increase mental and physical health behaviors, respectively.
                  We tested associations among MBC (independent variable), MIB
                  and BIM beliefs (proposed mediators), and mental and physical
                  health behaviors (dependent variables) using correlational
                  designs in Studies 1a to 1c. Results revealed positive
                  associations between MBC and (1) MIB and BIM and (2) mental
                  and physical health behaviors, as well as between MIB and
                  mental health behaviors and between BIM and physical health
                  behaviors. We then tested the full model in Study 2 with an
                  experimental manipulation of MBC and in Study 3 with a
                  two-wave longitudinal design. Both studies revealed
                  significant indirect effects of MBC on mental health behaviors
                  via MIB and on physical health behaviors via BIM. Together,
                  our findings suggest that one can encourage mental health
                  behaviors by emphasizing the mind-to-body connection and
                  physical health behaviors by highlighting the body-to-mind

                  think or react negatively toward uncertain events may have
                  implication on individuals' mental health and psychological
                  wellbeing. The Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-12 (IU-12) is
                  commonly used across the globe to measure IU, however, its'
                  psychometric properties are yet to be evaluated in Iran with a
                  Persian-speaking population. Therefore, the purpose of this
                  research was to translate and validate the IU-12 among Iranian
                  undergraduate students. Materials and Methods: The multi-stage
                  cluster random sampling was employed to recruit 410 Iranian
                  undergraduate students (260 females) from the Azad University
                  to complete the IU-12, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-2,
                  and the Penn State Worry Questionnaire in a cross-sectional
                  design. In this study, face validity, content validity,
                  construct validity, and concurrent validity were measured and
                  Construct Reliability (CR) and Cronbach's alpha were used to
                  measure reliability. Results: The impact score of the
                  translated IU-12 indicated acceptable face validity (value of
                  impact score was greater than 1.5). The value of Content
                  Validity Index (CVI) and the value of Content Validity Ratio
                  (CVR) were above 0.7 and 0.78, respectively. The values of CVI
                  and CVR indicated the items had acceptable content validity
                  and were deemed essential to the measure. The measurement
                  model analysis showed the measure with two subscales had good
                  fit indices (CMIN/df = 2.75, p < 0.01, RMSEA = 0.07, TLI =
                  0.94, CFI = 0.95, GFI = 0.94). A Confirmatory Factor Analysis
                  (CFA) indicated the scale was composed of the two subscales
                  found in the English-version of the scale (prospective anxiety
                  and inhibitory anxiety), and no items were removed from the
                  scale. The values of CR (0.86) and Cronbach's alphas (0.89)
                  showed the measure had appropriate internal consistency.
                  Conclusion: The findings support the psychometric properties
                  of the Persian version of the IU-12. This scale could be used
                  to reliably and accurately measure uncertainty intolerance
                  among undergraduate students in Iran.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses how consumers resolve decisions
                  involving conflict between attributes linked to highly valued
                  goals, such as an automobile purchase decision requiring
                  determination of how much safety one is willing to sacrifice
                  in order to obtain other benefits. One salient goal for these
                  decisions may be coping with or minimizing the negative
                  emotion generated during decision making. The conceptual
                  framework developed in this article predicts that choosing
                  avoidant options (e.g., the option to maintain the status quo)
                  can satisfy coping goals by minimizing explicit confrontation
                  of negative potential decision consequences and difficult
                  trade-offs. Two experiments demonstrate that reported emotion
                  can be altered by manipulating decision attributes, that the
                  opportunity to choose an avoidant option mitigates levels of
                  reported emotion, and that increasingly emotion-laden decision
                  environments are associated with more choice of avoidant
                  options. Mediation analyses indicate that actual choice of an
                  avoidant option results in less retrospective negative emotion
                  (in experiment 1) and that increased initial negative emotion
                  results in increased choice of avoidant options (in experiment
                  2). Mediation analyses for experiment 2 also indicate that
                  increased response times mediate avoidant choice, in contrast
                  to explanations of the status quo bias and similar choice
                  phenomena that appeal to decision makers' desires to minimize
                  cognitive effort.},

                  wonder chambers 1⁄2lled with natural and technological
                  marvels, even late-twentieth-century supermarket tabloids–all
                  attest to the human fascination with things that violate our
                  basic ideas about reality. The study of morality and culture
                  is therefore an intrinsically fascinating topic. People have
                  created moralities as divergent as those of Nazis and Quakers,
                  headhunters and Jains. And yet, when we look closely at the
                  daily lives of people in divergent cultures, we can 1⁄2nd
                  elements that arise in nearly all of them– for example,
                  reciprocity, loyalty, respect for (some) authority, limits on
                  physical harm, and regulation of eating and sexuality. What
                  are we to make of this pattern of similarity within profound
                  difference? Social scientists have traditionally taken two
                  approaches. The empiricist approach posits that moral
                  knowledge, moral beliefs, moral action, and all the other
                  stuff of morality are learned in childhood. There is no moral
                  faculty or moral anything else built into the human mind,
                  although there may be some innate learning mechanisms that
                  enable the acquisition of later knowledge. To the extent that
                  there are similarities across cultures, they arise because all
                  cultures face similar problems (e.g., how to divide power and
                  resources, care for children, and resolve disputes) for which
                  they have often developed similar solutions. The nativist
                  approach, on the other hand, holds that knowledge about such
                  issues as fairness, harm, and respect for authority has been
                  built into the human mind by evolution. All children who are
                  raised in a reasonable environment will come to develop these
                  ideas, even if they are not taught by adults. To the extent
                  that there are differences across cultures, they arise because
                  of local variation in the implementation of universal moral},

                  in-group members). To this end, we examined fans of a
                  historically poor-performing team that had reversed course,
                  becoming a winner. We conducted semi-structured interviews
                  with supporters of Major League Baseball’s (MLB’s) Chicago
                  Cubs to explore how the team’s 2016 World Series (i.e.,
                  championship) win had impacted supporters’ identification with
                  the team. We noted two primary themes defining how the team
                  identity had changed: (1) different expectations for
                  performance following the championship; and (2) the team’s new
                  success representing a threat to interviewees’ understanding
                  of the team identity meaning. We also observed constants in
                  the composition of the team identity, factors unchanged by the
                  success. We make our primary contribution by addressing the
                  role of considerable team performance changes in the meaning
                  of team identity.},

  abstract     = {Network centrality is vital for employees to attain superior
                  performance or desired outcomes and yet we still know little
                  of what makes employees develop central positions. A major
                  challenge is that employees feel discomfort forming networks
                  for opportunistic purposes that benefit them directly. This
                  challenge can be overcome once we focus on the requirements
                  raised by jobs. This paper posits that employees will be
                  motivated to form networks in order to acquire the information
                  capacity needed to satisfy the information requirements raised
                  by the characteristics of their jobs. The study explores how
                  the five enriching job characteristics influence the central
                  position an employee occupies in the organizational network.
                  Interestingly, not all job characteristics benefit networks.
                  Evidence shows that task autonomy, task variety and task
                  significance exercise a positive effect on network centrality
                  but task identity and feedback from the job exercise a
                  negative effect. Network centrality then mediates the
                  relationship between job characteristics and performance.
                  While dispositional determinants explain only between 3\% and
                  5\% of variance in network centrality, the model presented
                  explains up to 32\% of variance, thereby offering a solid
                  answer to the core question of what determines network
                  centrality.},

                  Participants (N = 174, Mage 19.95, 86.2\% female) completed
                  the UCLA Loneliness Scale once before a 7‐day online diary
                  twice per day. Measures of daily stress and hassles were
                  completed before bed and sleep outcomes the following day.
                  Multilevel modelling found higher levels of loneliness were
                  associated with poorer sleep quality, greater pre‐sleep
                  arousal, morning tiredness, fewer total hours slept and higher
                  levels of daily stress and hassles across the 7‐day study.
                  Loneliness was found also to have indirect effects on sleep
                  quality, pre‐sleep arousal and morning tiredness through
                  prior‐day daily stress and hassles. In addition, loneliness
                  also had indirect effects on daily stress and hassles through
                  prior night sleep measures. The current findings suggest that
                  interventions aimed at mitigating the effects of loneliness
                  should also incorporate components that target modifiable risk
                  factors such as sleep and stress.},

                  Rapid progress in artificial intelligence has introduced a
                  fourth category for our moral psychology to deal with:
                  intelligent machines. Machines can perform as moral agents,
                  making decisions that affect the outcomes of human patients or
                  solving moral dilemmas without human supervision. Machines can
                  be perceived as moral patients, whose outcomes can be affected
                  by human decisions, with important consequences for
                  human–machine cooperation. Machines can be moral proxies that
                  human agents and patients send as their delegates to moral
                  interactions or use as a disguise in these interactions. Here
                  we review the experimental literature on machines as moral
                  agents, moral patients, and moral proxies, with a focus on

  abstract     = {Adolescence is a time during which we transition to
                  independence, explore new activities and begin pursuit of
                  major life goals. Goal-directed learning, in which we learn to
                  perform actions that enable us to obtain desired outcomes, is
                  central to many of these processes. Currently, our
                  understanding of goal-directed learning in adolescence is
                  itself in a state of transition, with the scientific community
                  grappling with inconsistent results. When we examine metrics
                  of goal-directed learning through the second decade of life,
                  we find that many studies agree there are steady gains in
                  performance in the teenage years, but others report that
                  adolescent goal-directed learning is already adult-like, and
                  some find adolescents can outperform adults. To explain the
                  current variability in results, sophisticated experimental
                  designs are being applied to test learning in different
                  contexts. There is also increasing recognition that
                  individuals of different ages and in different states will
                  draw on different neurocognitive systems to support
                  goal-directed learning. Through adoption of more nuanced
                  approaches, we can be better prepared to recognize and harness
                  adolescent strengths and to decipher the purpose (or goals) of
                  adolescence itself. During adolescence, we acquire skills and
                  behavioural patterns that support our future survival through
                  goal-directed learning. Wilbrecht and Davidow describe the
                  neural and cognitive systems that support goal-directed
                  learning in adolescence, as well as our growing understanding
                  of the influence of context on this process.},

  abstract     = {Reasoning is generally seen as a means to improve knowledge
                  and make better decisions. However, much evidence shows that
                  reasoning often leads to epistemic distortions and poor
                  decisions. This suggests that the function of reasoning should
                  be rethought. Our hypothesis is that the function of reasoning
                  is argumentative. It is to devise and evaluate arguments
                  intended to persuade. Reasoning so conceived is adaptive given
                  the exceptional dependence of humans on communication and
                  their vulnerability to misinformation. A wide range of
                  evidence in the psychology of reasoning and decision making
                  can be reinterpreted and better explained in the light of this
                  hypothesis. Poor performance in standard reasoning tasks is
                  explained by the lack of argumentative context. When the same
                  problems are placed in a proper argumentative setting, people
                  turn out to be skilled arguers. Skilled arguers, however, are
                  not after the truth but after arguments supporting their
                  views. This explains the notorious confirmation bias. This
                  bias is apparent not only when people are actually arguing,
                  but also when they are reasoning proactively from the
                  perspective of having to defend their opinions. Reasoning so
                  motivated can distort evaluations and attitudes and allow
                  erroneous beliefs to persist. Proactively used reasoning also
                  favors decisions that are easy to justify but not necessarily
                  better. In all these instances traditionally described as
                  failures or flaws, reasoning does exactly what can be expected
                  of an argumentative device: Look for arguments that support a
                  given conclusion, and, ceteris paribus, favor conclusions for
                  which arguments can be found.},

                  propositions (promises of reciprocal value between service

                  value‐in‐use, all within the conceptual context of
                  service‐dominant (S‐D)
                  logic.Design/methodology/approachResponding to calls in the
                  recent literature for an academic critique of S‐D logic, its
                  key constructs, and its application in marketing situations of
                  varying complexity, the paper presents a conceptual analysis
                  of the determinants of value emphasis in value propositions
                  from the S‐D perspective.FindingsFour guiding principles are
                  derived from a rigorous analysis of the relevant literatures.
                  Ways are discussed in which firms might achieve greater
                  flexibility in designing their market offerings, and thus
                  manage different customer segments using different value
                  propositions. The general conclusion is that the ability to
                  communicate a firm's value propositions strategically and
                  effectively is a new area for the development of competence at
                  the core of competitive advantage.Research
                  limitations/implicationsThe findings pave the way for
                  empirical research into the dynamics of value propositions.
                  Since the main focus of the conceptual framework is on the
                  customer‐provider dyad, future studies should broaden coverage
                  to multilateral settings and networked environments.Practical

                  Employing a computational approach, this study examined the
                  effect of moral salience in film reviews on film success. By
                  analyzing moral words from the Moral Foundation Dictionary in
                  a large corpus of approximately 1.6 million IMDb film reviews,
                  we found that moral salience in reviews was strongly

                  moral foundations identified as care, fairness, loyalty, and

                  initiates various networks to demonstrate how influencers

  abstract     = {Abstract It is a fact that the past research has explored
                  service-dominant logic (S-D logic) and value co-creation in
                  music marketing (Choi \& Burnes 2013; Gamble \& Gilmorex 2013;
                  Gamble 2018; Saragih 2019), yet a key aspect of S-D logic,
                  namely resource integration, is an unexplored territory and a
                  promising phenomenon of study. A scattering of evidence
                  demonstrates how actors, whether individuals or organisations,
                  in the music industry are making value propositions and
                  providing operand resources to users of platforms (Poell,
                  Nieborg, \& Van Dijck 2019), which may result in resource
                  integration and commercial success at a quick pace and on a
                  global scale. Using secondary data in an archival research
                  approach (Welch 2000), this paper examines TikTok, a rapidly
                  growing platform where users integrate short (e.g., under 15
                  s) clips of commercial music into user generated video content
                  in which users dance to, lip-sync with, accept social
                  challenges, integrate hashtags and create memes based on
                  musical content. Further, there is a discussion on evidence
                  about how music is being used by actors on TikTok in order to
                  argue that (a) S-D logic (Vargo \& Lusch 2016) is an
                  insightful perspective through which one is able to understand
                  music marketing; (b) music providers essentially make value
                  propositions with their music that other actors, such as music
                  consumers, can integrate into their lives through platforms
                  like TikTok; (c) changes in technology affect such resource
                  integration and how actors in the music industry can adapt to
                  such change; (d) value-in-social-context (Edvardsson,
                  Tronvoll, \& Gruber 2010) is a driver of resource integration
                  by users on the platform; and (e) this example of value
                  created by users on TikTok is just one example of the many
                  types of value which guide action and interaction on today’s
                  music platforms. The discussion and analysis is concluded with
                  several implications for research and practice.},

                  opportunity to be selective about the entertainment one

                  selection is predicted by preexisting beliefs — greater

                  functions of marriage that promote health. Thus, spouses
                  should be most likely to gain weight when either partner is
                  less satisfied because marital strain causes stress that
                  interferes with self-regulatory behaviors. The mating market
                  model, in contrast, suggests that weight maintenance is
                  motivated primarily by the desire to attract a mate. Thus,
                  spouses should be least likely to gain weight when either
                  partner is less satisfied because they should feel an
                  increased need to attract a new mate. This longitudinal study
                  of 169 newlywed couples evaluated each possibility. Methods:
                  Spouses completed measures of height, weight, marital
                  satisfaction, stress, steps toward divorce, and several
                  covariates biannually for 4 years. Results: Supporting the
                  mating market model, own and partner satisfaction were
                  positively associated with changes in weight, and this
                  association was mediated by steps toward divorce: Spouses who
                  were less satisfied than usual or had partners who were less
                  satisfied than usual were more likely to consider divorce and
                  thus less likely to gain weight. Conclusions: These findings
                  challenge the idea that quality relationships always benefit
                  health, suggesting instead that spouses in satisfying
                  relationships relax their efforts to maintain their weight
                  because they are no longer motivated to attract a mate.
                  Interventions to prevent weight gain in early marriage may
                  therefore benefit from encouraging spouses to think about
                  their weight in terms of health rather than appearance.

                  else being equal, a group of people engaged in a particular
                  behavior is generally more influential than a single
                  individual in inspiring others to adopt that behavior. The
                  current research challenges this seemingly intuitive idea by
                  showing that its validity depends on whether the focal
                  behavior is selfish. Seven experiments show that while
                  multiple people are indeed more influential than a single
                  individual in encouraging unselfish behavior, a single
                  individual can be just as influential as multiple people in
                  encouraging selfish behavior. We present evidence that this
                  phenomenon occurs because people generally have a preference
                  for the selfish option and seek justification for their
                  actions. Selfish behavior, whether exhibited by a single
                  individual or a group of people, provides a convenient
                  justification consistent with their preference for selfish
                  behavior. When it comes to unselfish behavior, however, a
                  larger group of influencers is required to counteract their
                  self-benefiting tendencies. Supporting this mechanism, the
                  effect is reversed when people have a pre-existing preference
                  for unselfishness or when selfish behavior is difficult to
                  justify.},

                  conditions. The points scored by drivers in a race
                  (standardised across seasons and Normalised) is used as the
                  response variable in a cross-classified multilevel model that
                  partitions variance into team, team-year and driver levels.
                  These effects are then allowed to vary by year, track type and
                  weather conditions using complex variance functions. Juan

                  Team effects are shown to be more important than driver

                  standing due to their capability to generate trust and alter
                  behaviors. Trust in the influencer has further encouraged the
                  followers to value the relationship equally and sometimes more
                  than family and friends. In a mixed‐method approach, the study
                  investigates the role played by SMIs as change agents by
                  generating trust. Partial least square structural equation
                  modeling (PLS‐SEM) was used to assess the measurement and
                  structural models. Findings reveal that influencer
                  characteristics—interactivity and
                  informativeness—significantly impact the followers' social,
                  physical, and emotional self‐concept. Trust fully mediated the
                  relationship between interactivity and emotional self‐concept,
                  and partially mediated the relationship between interactivity
                  and social \& physical self‐concept. However, informativeness
                  was not significant in building trust leading to self‐concept.
                  The findings imply that SMIs must engage in more consistent,
                  meaningful, and real conversations with their followers to
                  create an effective communication strategy. The current study
                  based on the findings develops a conceptual model to

                  Asymmetry. In seven studies ( N = 1,526), we present an
                  important caveat to this pattern: When people do notice and
                  acknowledge their advantages, they mostly focus on the
                  benefits they receive from other people (i.e., interpersonal

                  their demographics, personal traits, and life circumstances
                  (i.e., circumstantial benefits). We demonstrate that people
                  notice and remember others who helped them rather than hurt
                  them and that they notice the help they receive from people
                  more than from favorable, non-interpersonal factors. Finally,

                  helpful others (but not other advantages) and that changing
                  the salience of this norm affects people’s likelihood of
                  acknowledging the support they have received from others.},

              peak loads due to consumers' daily consumption behavior. This can
              be achieved by introducing dynamic pricing for demand flattening.
              However, uncoordinated consumer response may lead to a “herding
              effect”, where the majority of consumers adjust their electricity
              consumption toward the same cheap time slots (hence, creating new
              peaks). To overcome this problem, in this paper, we explore
              strategies of assigning non-uniform participation rates to
              consumers. We employ a generic method to find a nearly-optimal
              distribution setting for participation rates, which can be tuned

              experiments, we show that our approach is very effective as
              compared with existing ones in the literature. Moreover, we
              evaluate our approach in nonstationary environment, when consumers
              change their consumption behavior from day to day. In order to
              maximize consumer convenience, we also propose another method that
              assigns low participation rates to more consumers (which means
              less-frequent changes in consumption schedules). Based on our
              methods, DSM designers are able to tune their systems toward
              performance or consumer convenience.},

                  is a rhetorical/psycholinguistic construct that analyzes how

                  teenagers, aged 15–18. Specifically, we examine three research
                  questions. First, what kind of content does the Polish youth
                  select on streaming platforms? Second, what is the role of
                  (dis)similarity between the characters and the viewers for
                  Polish youth in selecting their entertainment TV shows on
                  streaming platforms? Third, how do Polish youth understand the
                  possible effects of their streamed TV content on their
                  attitudes toward others? Based on 20 one-hour-long
                  semi-structured interviews, we found that viewers sought
                  psychologically complex and attractive characters,
                  irrespective of race or sexual orientation. Recognizing the
                  similarities of life experiences with TV characters mattered
                  in youth's decision about streaming content. Viewers also
                  appreciated characters different from themselves because they
                  were able to learn about them. The results are discussed with
                  the implications for media selection and effects studies.

                  of sleep loss on emotion is critical for promoting
                  psychological health. This preregistered systematic review and
                  meta-analysis quantified the effects of various forms of sleep
                  loss on multiple aspects of emotional experiences. Eligible
                  studies used experimental reductions of sleep via total sleep
                  deprivation, partial sleep restriction, or sleep fragmentation
                  in healthy populations to examine effects on positive affect,
                  negative affect, general mood disturbances, emotional
                  reactivity, anxiety symptoms, and/or depressive symptoms. In
                  total, 1,338 effect sizes across 154 studies were included (N
                  = 5,717; participant age range = 7–79 years). Random effects
                  models were conducted, and all forms of sleep loss resulted in
                  reduced positive affect (standardized mean difference [SMD] =
                  −0.27 to −1.14), increased anxiety symptoms (SMD = 0.57–0.63),
                  and blunted arousal in response to emotional stimuli (SMD =
                  −0.20 to −0.53). Findings for negative affect, reports of
                  emotional valence in response to emotional stimuli, and
                  depressive symptoms were mixed and depended on the type of
                  sleep loss. Nonlinear effects for the amount of sleep loss as
                  well as differences based on the stage of sleep restricted
                  (i.e., rapid eye movement sleep or slow-wave sleep) were also
                  detected. This study represents the most comprehensive
                  quantitative synthesis of experimental sleep and emotion
                  research to date and provides strong evidence that periods of
                  extended wakefulness, shortened sleep duration, and/or
                  nighttime awakenings adversely influence human emotional
                  functioning. Findings provide an integrative foundation for
                  future research on sleep and emotion and elucidate the precise
                  ways that inadequate sleep may impact our daytime emotional
                  lives. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights

                  comprehension knowledge, working memory capacity, and
                  processing speed, are regarded as some of the most stable
                  psychological traits, yet there exist no large-scale
                  systematic efforts to document the specific patterns by which
                  their rank-order stability changes over age and time interval,
                  or how their stability differs across abilities, tests, and
                  populations. Determining the conditions under which cognitive
                  abilities exhibit high or low degrees of stability is critical
                  not just to theory development but to applied contexts in
                  which cognitive assessments guide decisions regarding
                  treatment and intervention decisions with lasting consequences
                  for individuals. In order to supplement this important area of
                  research, we present a meta-analysis of longitudinal studies
                  investigating the stability of cognitive abilities. The
                  meta-analysis relied on data from 205 longitudinal studies
                  that involved a total of 87,408 participants, resulting in
                  1,288 test–retest correlation coefficients among manifest
                  variables. For an age of 20 years and a test–retest interval
                  of 5 years, we found a mean rank-order stability of ρ = .76.
                  The effect of mean sample age on stability was best described
                  by a negative exponential function, with low stability in
                  preschool children, rapid increases in stability in childhood,
                  and consistently high stability from late adolescence to late
                  adulthood. This same functional form continued to best
                  describe age trends in stability after adjusting for test
                  reliability. Stability declined with increasing test–retest
                  interval. This decrease flattened out from an interval of
                  approximately 5 years onward. According to the age and
                  interval moderation models, minimum stability sufficient for
                  individual-level diagnostic decisions (rtt = .80) can only be
                  expected over the age of 7 and for short time intervals in
                  children. In adults, stability levels meeting this criterion
                  are obtained for over 5 years. (PsycInfo Database Record (c)

  abstract     = {In theory, it can be strategically advantageous for
                  competitors to make themselves unpredictable to their
                  opponents, for example, by variably mixing hostility and
                  friendliness. Empirically, it remains open whether and how
                  competitors make themselves unpredictable, why they do so, and
                  how this conditions conflict dynamics and outcomes. We examine
                  these questions in interactive attacker–defender contests, in
                  which attackers invest to capture resources held and defended
                  by their opponent. Study 1, a reanalysis of nine (un)published
                  experiments (total N = 650), reveals significant cross-trial
                  variability especially in proactive attacks and less in
                  reactive defense. Study 2 (N = 200) shows that greater
                  variability makes both attacker’s and defender’s next move
                  more difficult to predict, especially when variability is due
                  to occasional rather than (in)frequent extreme investments in
                  conflict. Studies 3 (N = 27) and 4 (N = 106) show that
                  precontest testosterone, a hormone associated with risk-taking
                  and status competition, drives variability during attack
                  which, in turn, increases sympathetic arousal in defenders and
                  defender variability (Study 4). Rather than being motivated by
                  wealth maximization, being unpredictable in conflict and
                  competition emerges in function of the attacker’s desire to
                  win “no matter what” and comes with significant welfare cost
                  to both victor and victim. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024

                  Stereotype research emphasizes systematic processes over
                  seemingly arbitrary contents, but content also may prove
                  systematic. On the basis of stereotypes' intergroup functions,
                  the stereotype content model hypothesizes that (1) 2 primary
                  dimensions are competence and warmth, (2) frequent mixed
                  clusters combine high warmth with low competence
                  (paternalistic) or high competence with low warmth (envious),
                  and (3) distinct emotions (pity, envy, admiration, contempt)
                  differentiate the 4 competence-warmth combinations.
                  Stereotypically, (4) status predicts high competence, and
                  competition predicts low warmth. Nine varied samples rated
                  gender, ethnicity, race, class, age, and disability
                  out-groups. Contrary to antipathy models, 2 dimensions
                  mattered, and many stereotypes were mixed, either pitying (low
                  competence, high warmth subordinates) or envying (high
                  competence, low warmth competitors). Stereotypically, status
                  predicted competence, and competition predicted low warmth.

                  stereotypes of vegans and developed a scale to measure them.
                  Stereotypes of vegans assorted into three positive

                  negative (unconventional, condescending, and unhealthy)

                  they understood their motivations for their diet, were
                  familiar with vegans, and shared their concerns for the
                  environment. In contrast, meat-eaters who perceived vegans
                  more negatively were more conservative, had a strong

                  mostly System 1 for direct affect transfer, with referential
                  learning as a mix of the two. The CTM aims to bring clarity

                  of interrelations between operating principles (“what” brand
                  associations are learned), operating processes (“how” brand
                  associations are learned), and operating conditions (“when”
                  brand associations are learned). For consumer and learning
                  researchers, the CTM outlines an agenda for future research
                  and guidelines to improve conceptual and methodological
                  clarity. For brand managers, the CTM provides tactical
                  recommendations (a “toolkit”) for structuring advertising
                  campaigns to create desired brand associations and strategic
                  recommendations for managing brand partnerships. For
                  policymakers, the CTM offers guidance on types of
                  advertisements requiring closer scrutiny.},

                  in interest in consumer language research. This article

                  identifying key themes and trends and highlighting topics for
                  future research. Work has evolved from exploration of broad
                  language concepts (e.g., rhetorics) to specific linguistic
                  features (e.g., phonemes) and from monologues (e.g.,
                  advertiser to consumer) to two-way dialogues (e.g., consumer
                  to service representative and back). We discuss future
                  opportunities that arise from past trends and suggest two
                  important shifts that prompt questions for future research:
                  the new shift toward using voice (vs. hands) when interacting
                  with objects and the ongoing shift toward using hands (vs.
                  voices) to communicate with people. By synthesizing the past,
                  and delineating a research agenda for the future, we hope to
                  encourage more researchers to begin to explore this burgeoning

                  value and argues that to seriously address inequality during
                  the next 50 years, consumer research must explore processual
                  aspects of value hierarchy and consider its relationship to
                  inequality. Doing so recognizes the duality of structures as
                  embodying outcomes and agency, as well as the need to view
                  value not only as what it is but also as what it does. To
                  begin to address limitations in the literature, we use
                  empirical evidence from an investigation of the cancer care
                  market from 1970 to 2021 to understand how value hierarchy
                  shapes and manifests as inequality. This is conceptualized as:
                  distribution of multilevel resources, consolidation of
                  consumer power, stratification of consumer agency, and
                  (de)credentialization of worthiness. Building on each of
                  these, we discuss a research agenda for future JCR inquiries

  abstract     = {Abstract This research shows that although the used and unused
                  versions of a digital good (e.g., virtual apparel) are
                  identical in every pixel and functionality, consumers tend to
                  prefer the unused version. This “genesis effect” occurs
                  because consumers tend to perceive used (vs. unused) digital
                  goods as virtually contaminated and because being permanently
                  listed as the first (vs. subsequent) owner in the ownership
                  record can confer a greater sense of status. Specifically, in
                  study 1, analyses of large-scale field data on purchases of
                  digital goods in the metaverse showed that consumers paid
                  substantially more to acquire the unused (vs. used) version of
                  the same good. Studies 2–4 causally demonstrated the genesis
                  effect and its underlying mechanism across metaverse product
                  categories—participants were less likely to purchase digital
                  goods described as used (vs. unused). Virtual contamination
                  and virtual status jointly mediated the effect. Furthermore,
                  being the first—at the genesis of a digital product’s usage
                  history—was particularly special, such that participants were
                  less sensitive to increases in the number of prior owners
                  after the first one. Finally, showing participants that a used
                  good had been digitally reconstituted attenuated the genesis
                  effect. These findings add to the literature on consumer
                  behavior in the metaverse and offer managerial insights on
                  digital goods marketing.},

                  appearing in the top four journals for consumer research—JCR,
                  JMR, JM, and JCP—by examining factors that influence
                  scholarly, public, and practical impact. This conceptually
                  distinguishes between “incongruent novelty” (novelty arising
                  from incongruity between an article and other existing
                  articles) and “recombinant novelty” (novelty based on drawing
                  from more disparate references). Incongruent novelty is
                  decomposed into two components: (1) topic
                  incongruity—incongruity between an article's topic and other
                  existing topics at the time and (2) article
                  incongruity—incongruity between an article and other existing
                  articles on the same primary topic. By integrating topic
                  modeling and word embedding to measure these constructs, we
                  demonstrate varying impacts of types of novelty on three types
                  of impact. Overall, our findings illustrate that topic and
                  article incongruity have effects above and beyond recombinant
                  novelty. For both scholarly and public impact, our results
                  suggest that moderately high topic incongruity has the largest
                  influence, suggesting that researchers should address novel
                  topics. Additionally, scholarly citations are positively
                  affected by lower and higher (vs. moderate) levels of article
                  incongruity, suggesting that researchers either engage in
                  programmatic research or add a new approach to the existing
                  research on a topic.},

  abstract     = {HCM has long been considered the most frequent cause of death
                  in athletes, and reason for disqualification from sport.
                  However, our perception of the impact of sports on HCM is
                  largely based on anecdotal evidence. In this review, we
                  provide a reappraisal of current knowledge relative to 1) the
                  impact of sport on LV remodeling, and 2) on the clinical
                  outcome of HCM in athletes. 1) The limited available evidence
                  argues against the hypothesis that intensive exercise
                  conditioning may trigger and/or worsen the development of LV
                  hypertrophy or cause changes in LV function in adult HCM
                  athletes. 2) Recent observations challenge the concept of a
                  detrimental effect of sport on HCM clinical course. The
                  Reset-HCM study showed that 16-week moderate-intensity
                  exercise resulted in a small, significant increase in exercise
                  capacity and no adverse events. In a cohort of 88 low-risk HCM
                  athletes followed for a 7-year period, survival analyses
                  showed no difference in mortality between HCM who discontinued
                  or pursued vigorous exercise programmes. Further reassurance
                  was provided by the ICD Sports Safety Registry. Clinical
                  implications: At present, patients' attitude to sport
                  participation is highly variable, based on social and legal
                  backgrounds surrounding medical practice in different
                  countries. The shared-decision-making as suggested by current
                  US and European guidelines allows the physician to deliver a
                  tailored and more liberal advice. Physicians should be aware
                  of the changing paradigm relative to exercise and sport
                  prescription for HCM and promote active lifestyle as an
                  integral component of modern management of HCM patients.},

                  psychological diseases showing a high co-morbidity. They have
                  a severe impact on the lives of the persons concerned. Many
                  meta-analytical studies suggested a positive anxiolytic and
                  depression-reducing effect of exercise programs. The aim of
                  the present article is to synthesize metaanalyses on the
                  effects of exercise on anxiety and depression and to describe
                  average effect sizes. For this purpose 37 meta-analyses were
                  included reporting 50 effect sizes for anxiety scores of
                  42,264 participants and depression scores of 48,207 persons.
                  The average documented anxiolytic effect of exercise in these
                  reviews was small, 0.34. In contrast, the effect of exercise
                  on depression was significantly higher and at a moderate
                  level, 0.56. Data of randomized controlled trials suggest
                  higher sizes for the effect of exercise on anxiety and
                  depression leading to increases up to moderate and large
                  effects, respectively. Additionally, exercise seems to be more
                  beneficial for patients compared to participants within a
                  non-clinical, normal range of psychological disease.
                  Especially for the effect of exercise on anxiety, more high
                  quality meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials are
                  needed. Finally, possible neurobiological explanations are
                  suggested for the positive effect of exercise on psychological
                  disorders like anxiety and depression.},

                  heterogeneity across studies. DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors
                  independently extracted data. DATA SYNTHESIS: Thirty-eight
                  studies with 1,907,580 participants were included in the
                  meta-analysis. The included studies had a total of 63,087
                  deaths. Higher levels of handgrip strength were associated
                  with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality (HR=0.69; 95\% CI,
                  0.64-0.74) compared with lower muscular strength, with a
                  slightly stronger association in women (HR=0.60; 95\% CI,
                  0.51-0.69) than men (HR=0.69; 95\% CI, 0.62-0.77) (all
                  P<.001). Also, adults with higher levels of muscular strength,
                  as assessed by knee extension strength test, had a 14\% lower
                  risk of death (HR=0.86: 95\% CI, 0.80-0.93; P<.001) compared
                  with adults with lower muscular strength. CONCLUSIONS: Higher
                  levels of upper- and lower-body muscular strength are
                  associated with a lower risk of mortality in adult population,
                  regardless of age and follow-up period. Muscular strength
                  tests can be easily performed to identify people with lower
                  muscular strength and, consequently, with an increased risk of
                  mortality.},

                  well-being, especially the mechanism of this link. This study
                  tested the positive effects of nostalgia on emotional
                  well-being (positive affect and negative affect) and cognitive
                  well-being (satisfaction with life) via gratitude. Two
                  experiments were conducted in samples of young adults who were
                  randomized to experimental or control conditions. The analyses
                  involved group comparisons as well as regression-based
                  analyses of mediation. In Experiment 1 (N = 196), we induced
                  nostalgia using a guided autobiographical recall procedure.
                  The nostalgia group had higher positive affect and gratitude,
                  and gratitude partially mediated the association between
                  nostalgia and positive affect. In Experiment 2 (N = 102), we
                  induced nostalgia by showing a nostalgic video from the period
                  when the participants were children. The nostalgia group had
                  higher positive affect and lower negative affect, and
                  gratitude partially mediated these associations. The findings
                  suggest that nostalgia could improve emotional well-being by
                  increasing gratitude, but may not alter cognitive well-being.},

                  modifier in English noun compounds has long posed a challenge
                  to semantic theories. We argue that the type of head-modifier
                  relation in an English endocentric noun-headed compound
                  depends on how its referent is categorized: specifically, on
                  whether the referent is conceptualized as anartifact, made by
                  humans for a purpose; or as anatural kind, existing
                  independently of humans. We propose the Events vs. Essences
                  Hypothesis: the modifier in an artifact-headed compound
                  typically refers to an event of use or creation associated
                  with that artifact, while the modifier in a natural
                  kind-headed compound typically makes reference to inherent
                  properties reflective of an abstract essence associated with
                  the kind, such as its perceptual properties or native habitat.
                  We present three studies substantiating this hypothesis.
                  First, in a corpus of almost 1,700 attested compounds in two
                  conceptual domains (food/cooking and precious
                  minerals/jewelry), we find that as predicted, compound names
                  referring to artifacts tend to evoke events, whereas compound
                  names referring to natural kinds tend to evoke essential
                  properties. Next, in a production experiment involving
                  compound creation and a comprehension experiment involving
                  compound interpretation, we find that the same tendencies also
                  extend to novel compounds.},

                  distinguish natural objects from artifacts. He begins by
                  stating that a natural object ‘has in itself a source of
                  change and staying unchanged, whether in respect of place, or
                  growth and decay, or alteration’. But this is not sufficient
                  to distinguish natural objects from artifacts. As he points
                  out later, a wooden bed, for example, can rot or burn, and
                  this is surely a change whose source is, in part, internal to
                  the bed. To make his distinction, Aristotle writes that in a
                  natural object the internal ‘source of change and remaining
                  unchanged’ belongs to it ‘primarily and of itself, that is,
                  not by virtue of concurrence’. The bed rots because it happens
                  to be made of wood: the change is due to its material, not due
                  to its essence, namely that it is a bed. A natural object,
                  however, changes because of its essence, that is, because it
                  is the natural object that it is.},

                  need for a very brief measure, 5 and 10-item inventories were
                  developed and evaluated. Although somewhat inferior to

                  adequate levels in terms of: (a) convergence with widely used

                  involving uncertain monetary rewards as if they were
                  maximizing expected utility of final assets. Explanations for
                  this behavior postulate that the cognitive demands of
                  consistency to such a theory are too great. However,
                  situations exist in which more than mental shortcuts are
                  involved and these anomalies raise questions about expected
                  utility theory as a guide to behavior. This paper explores the
                  possibility that expected utility theory appears to fail
                  because the single outcome descriptor—money—is not sufficient.
                  After making a decision under uncertainty, a person may
                  discover, on learning the relevant outcomes, that another
                  alternative would have been preferable. This knowledge may
                  impart a sense of loss, or regret. The decision maker who is
                  prepared to tradeoff financial return in order to avoid regret
                  will exhibit some of the behavioral paradoxes of decision
                  theory. By explicitly incorporating regret, expected utility
                  theory not only becomes a better descriptive predictor but
                  also may become a more convincing guide for prescribing
                  behavior to decision makers.},

  abstract     = {Learning and adaptation are essential for success. However,
                  human effort is inherently finite, which creates a dilemma for
                  employees. Is it better to prioritize capitalizing on existing
                  knowledge structures to maximize immediate performance
                  benefits (exploitation) or develop adaptive capabilities
                  (exploration) at the expense of short-term productivity?
                  Understanding how employees answer this question can inform
                  the design of evidence-based interventions for optimizing and
                  sustaining learning amidst workplace challenges. In this
                  article, we attempt to unpack the composition of on-task
                  effort during performance-based learning by testing the
                  proposition that the information–knowledge gap—a regulatory
                  discrepancy between unknown aspects of a task and a person’s
                  perceived competence in dealing with that task—is the
                  psychological mechanism responsible for guiding
                  effort-allocation decisions during performance-based learning.
                  In Study 1, we found that larger information–knowledge gaps
                  resulted in increased subsequent investments of on-task
                  attention within a sample of adults learning to perform a
                  complex task (N = 121). As participants learned,
                  information–knowledge gaps systematically shrank, resulting in
                  a reduced emphasis on learning-oriented effort (i.e.,
                  exploration) relative to achievement-oriented effort (i.e.,
                  exploitation) over time. In Study 2 (N = 176), a task-change
                  paradigm revealed that introducing novel demands caused
                  information–knowledge gaps to suddenly expand, which prompted
                  participants to increase on-task effort and shift their focus
                  away from achievement and back toward learning as an adaptive
                  response. Collectively, these findings support the notion that
                  information–knowledge gaps shape how (and when) on-task effort
                  is spent and present a framework for understanding how
                  learners strategically structure their limited attentional
                  resources. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights

  abstract     = {Objective: Exercise is increasingly used as adjunct treatment
                  for alcohol use disorder (AUD). Evidence suggests that
                  moderate-to-high-intensity exercise can ameliorate cravings.
                  We explored the potential mediating effects of changes in mood
                  states in the relationship between exercise intensity and
                  alcohol cravings. Method: Secondary analyses of a nested
                  single-arm trial within a randomized controlled trial
                  (FitForChange). In total, 117 sedentary adults (68.4\% female,
                  M = 52 ± 12 years) with clinician diagnosed (Diagnostic and
                  Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition) AUD and
                  indications of craving (Desire for Alcohol Questionnaire)
                  completed a 12-min submaximal cardiorespiratory fitness test
                  on a cycle ergometer. Assessments of craving, mood states
                  (POMS), and state anxiety (STAI-Y1) were taken immediately
                  before, after, and 30 min after exercise. Ratings of perceived
                  exertion (RPE) were included as indirect measures of exercise
                  intensity. The med4way command in Stata was used to explore
                  mediating and interaction effects of improvements in total
                  mood disturbance (TMD) and state anxiety. Results:
                  Improvements in mood and anxiety did not mediate the effect of
                  higher exercise intensity on reductions in alcohol craving. A
                  significant reference interaction was found between “hard” (or
                  greater) exertion and anxiety improvements (β = −1.06, 95\% CI
                  [−1.50, −0.61]). Participants whose anxiety reduced during
                  exercise had two times higher odds of reduced cravings when
                  exercising at a higher intensity than participants whose
                  anxiety worsened (OR = 2.04, 95\% CI [1.12, 3.72]).
                  Conclusions: Reductions in anxiety may partly explain the
                  positive effect of higher exercise intensity on alcohol
                  cravings. The findings are preliminary and require replication
                  in future studies. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all

                  (AI) and its widespread adoption in the marketplace, its
                  impact on consumer emotions has remained understudied. To fill
                  the gap, our study examines the impact of AI on consumer
                  emotions in the service industry by identifying and mitigating
                  its dark sides. We identified 12 dark side categories using a
                  systematic literature review and probed using a modified total
                  interpretive structural modelling (TISM) approach and MICMAC
                  analysis. Therefore, we follow an exploratory qualitative
                  approach based on in‐depth personal interviews with users of
                  short‐term technology‐based platform Airbnb in the hospitality
                  sector. The findings reveal six significant issues impacting
                  consumer perception and responses toward AI‐enabled services,
                  that is, authenticity, affective challenges, deployment
                  problems, ethical dilemmas, discrimination in service, and
                  adoption barriers. Our study advances the ongoing debate
                  around AI and human entrapment. The present investigation
                  contributes to the AI literature with a structured framework
                  for understanding the dark side of AI on consumer emotions and
                  the strategies to reduce those effects. The findings have
                  significant practical implications for the hospitality
                  industry, enabling it to prepare for a human‐centric approach
                  to designing and applying AI, ethical concerns with privacy
                  issues, and cultural expectations of the consumer. Finally, we
                  lay out an agenda for exciting AI‐dark side‐related future

                  psychological theories of anxiety. However, this concept has
                  been plagued by divergent connotations and
                  operationalizations. The lack of consensus hinders the current
                  search for cognitive and biological mechanisms of anxiety,
                  jeopardizes theory creation and comparison, and restrains
                  translation of basic research into improved diagnoses and
                  interventions. Drawing upon uncertainty decomposition in
                  Bayesian Decision Theory, we propose a well‐defined conceptual
                  structure of uncertainty in cognitive and clinical sciences,
                  with a focus on anxiety. We discuss how this conceptual
                  structure provides clarity and can be naturally applied to
                  existing frameworks of psychopathology research. Furthermore,
                  it allows formal quantification of various types of
                  uncertainty that can benefit both research and clinical
                  practice in the era of computational psychiatry.},

  abstract     = {Employees’ daily routines (e.g., commutes, lunch breaks,
                  conversations with coworkers or family members) are vital
                  rituals that create order and meaning. However, employees
                  frequently experience changes to how their work and nonwork
                  lives operate, which can generate discontinuity and spark
                  nostalgia—a sentimental longing for the past. In this study,
                  we draw from theory on the dual nature of emotional
                  ambivalence and the literature on emotion regulation to
                  explore countervailing effects of daily nostalgia on employee
                  performance. In a sample of employed adults recruited from a
                  northeastern U.S. university’s alumni database and LinkedIn (
                  n = 109), we used an experience sampling method to capture
                  within-individual variation in nostalgia over 3 weeks. Results
                  of multilevel path analysis showed, on one hand, nostalgia was
                  positively associated with employees’ cognitive change
                  strategies (e.g., reappraising one’s situation), which
                  translated into heightened organizational citizenship
                  behaviors; on the other hand, nostalgia was also positively
                  associated with employees’ attentional deployment strategies
                  (e.g., distraction), which reduced daily task performance and
                  increased daily counterproductive work behaviors.
                  Unexpectedly, results showed higher trait-level future
                  temporal focus exacerbated the positive effect of nostalgia on
                  attentional deployment. Our results suggest nostalgia embodies
                  a complex mix of emotions that impact individuals’ response
                  strategies and, ultimately, performance.},

                  researchers. Despite this past work, we argue there is a need
                  for a domain-specific conceptualization and measure of
                  financial mindfulness (FM). We first define FM as “the
                  tendency to be highly aware of one’s current objective
                  financial state while possessing an acceptance of that state,”
                  and, second, develop and validate an eight-item scale to
                  measure individual differences in FM. This article has nine
                  studies, including a field survey administered by a financial
                  services provider to examine actual behavior. Importantly, the
                  FM-Scale is associated with financial behaviors (i.e., sunk
                  cost bias) above and beyond related scales (i.e., money
                  management stress, self-control, and general mindfulness). To
                  the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to provide a
                  succinct way to measure FM that incorporates elements of both
                  awareness and acceptance, highlighting the role of financial

  abstract     = {Individuals living in either harsh or favorable environments
                  display well-documented psychological and behavioral
                  differences. For example, people in favorable environments
                  tend to be more future-oriented, trust strangers more, and
                  have more explorative preferences. To account for such
                  differences, psychologists have turned to evolutionary biology
                  and behavioral ecology, in particular, the literature on
                  life-history theory and pace-of-life syndrome. However,
                  critics have found that the theoretical foundations of these
                  approaches are fragile and that differences in life expectancy
                  cannot explain vast psychological and behavioral differences.
                  In this article, we build on the theory of optimal resource
                  allocation to propose an alternative framework. We hypothesize
                  that the quantity of resources available, such as income, has
                  downstream consequences on psychological traits, leading to
                  the emergence of behavioral syndromes. We show that more
                  resources lead to more long-term orientation, more tolerance
                  of variance, and more investment in low marginal-benefit
                  needs. At the behavioral level, this translates, among others,
                  into more large-scale cooperation, more investment in health,
                  and more exploration. These individual-level differences in
                  behavior, in turn, account for cultural phenomena such as
                  puritanism, authoritarianism, and innovation.},

  abstract     = {This article argues that the capacity of music to reliably cue
                  both autobiographical memories and fictional imaginings can be
                  leveraged to better understand the relationship and
                  interdependence between memory and imagination more generally.
                  The multiple levels involved in musical engagement provide a
                  rich forum for investigating how emotional, semantic, and
                  contextual associations with musical cues influence both
                  memories and imaginings. Moreover, musical excerpts are
                  extended in time and can influence the trajectory of a memory
                  or imagining dynamically as it develops, allowing for a more
                  precise manipulation of the implied semantic space. Because
                  music’s uses and contextual associations are culturally
                  constrained, and culture can be shared, autobiographical
                  memories and fictional imaginings cued by music can show
                  surprising similarities among individuals from the same
                  culture. This article surveys the research on music-evoked
                  autobiographical memories and music-evoked fictional
                  imaginings, proposing a framework for bringing these separate
                  strands of work together to shed light on larger questions
                  about shared underlying mechanisms.},

                  grit and curiosity, in predicting creative achievement in an
                  adult sample (N = 522). Grit has been related to achievement
                  in various domains, and although prior empirical work failed
                  to find associations with everyday creative activities in
                  adolescent and young adult samples, theoretically it is
                  relevant to long‐term creative achievement (which requires
                  persistence). Curiosity supports creative achievement through
                  positive judgments of novelty and an intrinsic motivation to
                  approach instead of avoid uncertainty, and both novelty and
                  uncertainty are central to the creative process. Results
                  showed that the perseverance dimension of grit positively
                  predicted creative achievement, whereas the consistency of
                  interests dimension was negatively related to creative
                  achievement. Additionally, five curiosity dimensions predicted
                  creative achievement above grit. In particular, thrill seeking
                  predicted creative achievement in both art and science;
                  deprivation sensitivity positively predicted creative
                  achievement in art. Our research suggests that, instead of a
                  narrow focus on consistency of interest, creative achievement
                  benefits from curiosity.},

                  However, scientists remain concerned that public engagement
                  takes time away from conducting research. Little is known
                  about the relationship between scientists’ productivity and
                  their willingness to participate in different types of public
                  engagement. Using a census survey of scientists from 30 U.S.
                  land-grant universities ( N = 5,208), we find that productive
                  scientists are slightly more willing to participate in public
                  scholarship than less productive scientists. In addition,
                  social science consideration, institutional incentives, and
                  self-efficacy are associated with a greater willingness to
                  participate in public scholarship and informal science

                  Concurrently, smartphone use encourages instant information
                  searching and communication, which promotes in-destination
                  decision-making and plan changes. However, previous studies
                  have provided a limited understanding of in-destination
                  decisions, particularly when travel companions are involved.
                  This study thus adopted sociomateriality as a theoretical tool
                  to offer a sociotechnical perspective in examining the
                  interactions between travelers and their smartphones in an
                  in-destination group decision-making context. We identified
                  three communication patterns in group decision-making during

                  knowledgeability, thriftiness, referenceability, and

                  the purchase intention of their audience. Aside from products,
                  influencers also promote certain lifestyles and behaviors.
                  Food influencers, for example, frequently feature home
                  cooking, a healthier behavior compared to snacking or dining
                  out. This study explored the potential of social media
                  influencers in promoting such behavior. Driven by social
                  cognitive theory, we explored whether self‐efficacy, perceived
                  benefits, and concerns (social, entertainment, health, and
                  economic) relate to the intention of the audience to cook at
                  home following the recipes an Instagram influencer provides.
                  We conducted three separate studies (two surveys and one
                  experiment) with a French population of social network
                  platform users. Our results showed that the entertainment
                  value of an observed behavior is the main driver for imitation
                  on social media, along with self‐efficacy, at least for women.
                  Mixed results were obtained for social benefits. The perceived
                  ease of the recipe, cooking experience, and explicit verbal
                  encouragement were positively related to self‐efficacy.
                  Surprisingly, the effect of health and economic benefits or
                  concerns and labeling was not confirmed.},

                  history are of enormous interest. There is, however,
                  uncertainty about the accurate measurement of eminence and
                  creativity. The most tenable measurement approach is
                  historiometric. Nearly all historiometric research on eminence
                  and creative achievement has involved Western samples. The
                  present investigation used historiometry to test two
                  hypotheses about creative achievement with Eastern samples.
                  These point to developmental adversity (DA) and the
                  “madness‐to‐genius link” thought to facilitate unusual
                  cognitive patterns and thus a creative capacity. Here,
                  historiometric methods were applied to a sample of 55 eminent
                  scientists in the Chinese Tang and Song dynasties. DA and
                  mental illness did not significantly predict Chinese
                  scientists' creative outcomes. Other diversifying experiences,
                  such as religious beliefs, migration, and role model mentors,
                  had a positive relationship with eminence and creative
                  achievement. The Tang and Song dynasties had different
                  religious structures, so religion had a different impact on
                  the creative achievements of scientists. In the Tang Dynasty,
                  religion could positively predict the creative achievements of
                  scientists, while in the Song Dynasty it could not. These
                  findings warrant further research using other eminent creators

                  psychological functions of mindfulness and how they complement
                  the psychological resources depleted in the performance of
                  creativity. Thus, guaranteeing the completion of
                  creativity‐related activities. We used a three‐time lag design

                  explore the impact of employees' mindfulness on their

                  capital and creative process engagement in the relationship

                  financial overconfidence to predict consumers' crypto
                  investment intentions. Study 2 (N = 1741) revealed that less

                  research that emphasizes social justice and cultural humility.
                  In the current article, we report on the use of the “Paper
                  Chase” as a team science training and research experience that
                  also facilitates cultural humility in research and when
                  working in teams. The Paper Chase is a synchronous writing
                  exercise originally conceptualized by a cohort of health
                  service psychology interns to reduce lag time between article
                  writing and submission (Schaumberg et al., 2015). The Paper
                  Chase involves a group of trainees coming together for a
                  predetermined amount of time (e.g., 9 or more hours) with the
                  aim of writing and submitting a full article for publication.
                  In the current article, we extend a previous report on the
                  Paper Chase by formally linking the training experience to the
                  four phases of team science: development, conceptualization,
                  implementation, and translation. We also discuss ways in which
                  the Paper Chase as a training experience can promote cultural
                  humility. Finally, we provide updated recommendations for
                  successfully completing a Paper Chase project. Overall, the
                  authors of this article who were predoctoral psychology
                  interns across two recent cohorts at one academic medical
                  center reported positive experiences from the Paper Chase. In
                  addition, the present study suggests that the Paper Chase can
                  be used as one activity that facilitates critical training in
                  team science. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all

                  marketing has compelled businesses to adjust to the changing
                  landscape of the digital age. This adjustment is driven by the
                  substantial influence that social media influencers (SMIs)
                  wield over consumer decision‐making; however, prior research
                  often treated SMI strategy, content, and credibility as
                  separate elements, leaving a knowledge gap on how these
                  elements intersect and collectively influence SMI and consumer
                  behavior. This study aimed to bridge this research gap by
                  synthesizing existing literature on SMIs and consumer decision
                  making, with a focus on SMI strategy, content, and
                  credibility. It employed a systematic literature review with a
                  hybrid domain‐based approach, integrating the strengths of
                  various review types while addressing their limitations. This
                  study employed a constructivist qualitative methodology with a
                  reflexive thematic analysis approach. It focused on
                  synthesizing and analyzing literature from EBSCO databases on
                  social media influencer marketing and consumer behavior,
                  following carefully designed inclusion and exclusion criteria.
                  The findings revealed that SMI Strategy, SMI Content, and SMI
                  Credibility are interconnected components of SMI marketing,
                  and even subtle modifications to these elements can
                  significantly influence consumer decision‐making. This study
                  provides a holistic understanding of SMI marketing,
                  emphasizing the interplay of SMI strategy, content, and
                  credibility in shaping consumer choices. It offers valuable
                  insights for businesses navigating the dynamic landscape of
                  SMI marketing increasing their comprehension of the
                  phenomenon.},

                  people to use different types of creative problem solving, but
                  this conflicts with recent theory arguing that individuals are
                  most creative under a moderate level of constraint. To resolve
                  this issue, this paper proposes a combinatorial theory of
                  constraints that argues it is necessary to understand how
                  multiple dimensions of constraint (e.g., on problems and
                  resources) work together to influence creativity, rather than
                  study them in isolation. Accordingly, two conditions can
                  enhance creativity—either through divergent problem solving or
                  emergent problem solving—because they produce an overall
                  balanced combination of constraint that improves important
                  psychological mechanisms of creativity such as intrinsic
                  motivation and creative search. Alternatively, two other
                  conditions can hinder creativity—either due to ambiguous
                  opportunity or futile effort—because they produce a combined
                  low or high level of constraint on a task.},

                  Task to systematically dissect the process of nostalgic
                  recall. Through this methodological approach, distinct
                  thematic elements are identified across 10 data sets ( N =

                  unveiled, ranging from Family and Positive Affect to Longing
                  and Place. The interplay of these thematic categories with the
                  psychological consequences of nostalgia reveals a complex and
                  multifaceted pattern. Notably, themes associated with positive

                  industrial design students were exposed to both intuitive and
                  logical design approaches to resolving briefs during a 1-day
                  workshop. The intuitive approach encouraged an open and
                  informal take on idea development grounded in past-experience,
                  whereas the logical approach emphasized structured and
                  sequential problem analysis. In a within-subjects design, half
                  the students adopted an intuitive approach in the morning and
                  a logical one in the afternoon to solve design briefs, whereas
                  the reverse applied to the other half. Students rated their
                  experiences on five 7-point scales after 30 min into the
                  session and on a different set of 10 scales at the end of the
                  2-hr session, and their design proposals were assessed by
                  experts. Results showed that the intuitive approach energized
                  participants and stimulated idea generation after 30 min, but
                  teamwork was challenging. The logical approach lent confidence
                  to the students and was easier to adopt, but only after
                  applying an intuitive approach in the morning session.
                  Students found it more challenging to complete their proposals
                  after 120 min in the logical condition. Proposals by students
                  in the intuitive condition comprised mostly images, while
                  those created in the logical condition were highly verbal.
                  Critical self-evaluation by students was reflected in higher
                  ratings of proposals by the judges. (PsycInfo Database Record

  abstract     = {Recently, a group of media scholars proposed that eudaimonic
                  entertainment experiences can be differentiated into
                  inward-driven and outward-driven experiences. The current
                  study empirically tested this proposition by focusing on
                  transcendent portrayals (i.e., content or character portrayals
                  that focus on something greater than oneself) as one content
                  characteristic to differentiate the proposed
                  inward/self-focused from more outward/other-focused effects
                  within the context of eudaimonic TV shows. A preregistered
                  experiment (N = 147) revealed that highly transcendent TV
                  shows elicited more self-transcendent emotions, universalism,
                  and money donation behavior, as well as fewer self-image
                  goals, than less transcendent TV shows. As expected, there was
                  no difference between conditions in mixed affect (all but one
                  of the TV shows), contemplation, and intrinsic need
                  satisfaction. The results indicate that outward-oriented
                  narratives include entertainment experiences previously
                  associated with inward-oriented narratives, but not
                  necessarily vice versa. The role of types of transcendent
                  portrayals, quality of portrayals, and number of portrayals
                  for the differentiation of various eudaimonic entertainment
                  experiences are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024

  abstract     = {Theories have proposed diverse reasons for why individual
                  differences such as personality traits lead to social status
                  attainment in face-to-face groups. We integrated these
                  different theoretical standpoints into a model with four paths
                  from individual differences to status: a dominance, a
                  competence, a virtue, and a micropolitics path. To investigate
                  these paths, we meta-analyzed over 100 years of research on
                  bivariate associations of personality traits, cognitive
                  abilities, and physical size with the attainment of
                  status-related outcomes in face-to-face groups (1,064 effects
                  from 276 samples including 56,153 participants). The
                  status-related outcome variables were admiring respect, social
                  influence, popularity (i.e., being liked by others),
                  leadership emergence, and a mixture of outcome variables. The
                  meta-analytic correlations we found were largely in line with
                  the micropolitics path, tentatively in line with the
                  competence and virtue paths, and only partly in line with the
                  dominance path. These findings suggest that status attainment
                  depends not only on the competence and virtue of an individual
                  but also on how individuals can enhance their apparent
                  competence or virtue by behaving assertively, by being
                  extraverted, or through self-monitoring. We also investigated
                  how the relations between individual differences and
                  status-related outcomes were moderated by kind of
                  status-related outcome, nature of the group task, culture
                  (collectivism/individualism), and length of acquaintance. The
                  moderation analysis yielded mixed and inconclusive results.
                  The review ends with directions for research, such as the need
                  to separately assess and study the different status-related
                  outcomes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights

  abstract     = {PurposeExamining emotional solidarity that drives tourists’
                  nostalgia has received significant attention, offering
                  valuable insights that can aid in the selection of a travel
                  destination. However, tourists’ nostalgia, along with its
                  antecedents—perceived safety risk and emotional solidarity,
                  has gained less attention within the setting of Pakistan.
                  Therefore, this research has been carried out and validated a
                  research framework using the stimulus-organism-response model
                  to investigate the links between perceived safety risk,
                  emotional solidarity—welcoming nature, emotional closeness,
                  sympathetic understanding, perceived nostalgia, and
                  destination advocacy intentions. In addition, this model
                  employed destination attachment—place identity and place
                  dependence—as a boundary condition on the relationships
                  between emotional solidarity and advocacy
                  intentions.Design/methodology/approachThis study collected 545
                  responses through two methods: offline distribution of print
                  copies of the questionnaire and online surveys from domestic
                  tourists who visited scenic destinations last year. Structural
                  equation modeling (SEM) was performed using AMOS 26, and the
                  PROCESS macro was conducted using IBM SPSS 28.FindingsThe
                  findings highlighted that perceived safety risk negatively
                  influences emotional solidarity—welcoming nature, emotional
                  closeness, sympathetic understanding—, resulting in a positive
                  effect on perceived nostalgia. Furthermore, tourists’
                  perceived nostalgia positively triggers advocacy intentions.
                  The findings also confirmed the boundary conditions of
                  destination attachment—place identity and place dependence—on
                  the association between emotional solidarity and perceived
                  nostalgia.Practical implicationsThree major practical
                  implications of these findings: First, ensuring visitor safety
                  with smart security measures, digital tools for quick
                  response, and local community involvement. Second,
                  highlighting local markets, art, and architecture to enrich
                  cultural experiences and promote accessibility and diversity.
                  Finally, using marketing to generate nostalgic experiences
                  through local collaborations, professional storytelling, and
                  engaging social media content to build emotional ties and
                  curiosity.Originality/valueIn terms of originality, this is
                  pioneering research intended at developing and validating the
                  model in the context of Pakistani destinations. Furthermore,
                  this marks the initial step in examining the proposed
                  relationships between perceived safety risk and emotional
                  solidarity in fostering tourists' perceived nostalgia,
                  ultimately leading to a strong desire to advocate for the
                  destination.},

                  marketing is an effective option for seeding. However, the
                  current managerially relevant question for direct-to-consumer
                  firms of whether to target low- or high-followership
                  influencers to generate immediate revenue is still unresolved.
                  In this article, the authors’ goal is to answer this question
                  by considering for the first time the whole
                  influencer-marketing funnel, that is, from followers on
                  user-generated content networks (e.g., on Instagram), to
                  reached followers, to engagement, to actual revenue, while
                  accounting for the cost of paid endorsements. The authors find
                  that low-followership targeting outperforms high-followership
                  targeting by order of magnitude across three performance
                  (return on investment) metrics. A mediation analysis reveals
                  that engagement can explain the negative relationship between
                  the influencer followership levels and return on investment.
                  This is in line with the rationale based on social capital
                  theory that with higher followership levels of an influencer,
                  the engagement between an influencer and their followers
                  decreases. These two findings are derived from secondary sales
                  data of 1,881,533 purchases and results of three full-fledged
                  field studies with hundreds of paid influencer endorsements,

                  depends not only on the signal’s content but also on a
                  receiver’s individual experience. Experiences throughout life
                  may interact to affect behavioural plasticity, such that a
                  lack of developmental sensory exposure could constrain adult
                  learning, while salient adult social experiences could remedy
                  developmental deficits. We investigated how experiences impact
                  the formation and direction of female auditory preferences in
                  the zebra finch. Zebra finches form long-lasting pair bonds
                  and females learn preferences for their mate’s vocalizations.
                  We found that after 2 weeks of cohabitation with a male,
                  females formed pair bonds and learned to prefer their
                  partner’s song regardless of whether they were reared with
                  (‘normally reared’) or without (‘song-naive’) developmental
                  exposure to song. In contrast, females that heard but did not
                  physically interact with a male did not prefer his song. In
                  addition, previous work has found that song-naive females do
                  not show species-typical preferences for courtship song. We
                  found that cohabitation with a male ameliorated this
                  difference in preference. Thus, courtship and pair bonding,
                  but not acoustic-only interactions, strongly influence
                  preference learning regardless of rearing experience, and may
                  dynamically drive auditory plasticity for recognition and
                  preference.},

                  typology of nostalgia called vintage anemoia. Vintage anemoia

                  vintage cues, regardless of specific historical periods or
                  individual lived experiences. Through a series of seven
                  studies, the authors demonstrate that vintage typography, by
                  evoking feelings of vintage anemoia, can enhance consumer
                  perceptions of product safety. This effect has positive
                  downstream consequences on key marketing outcomes, including
                  brand attitude, purchase intention, and willingness to pay.
                  Furthermore, the effect of vintage anemoia on product safety
                  perceptions remains unaffected by whether product safety
                  information indicates that a product is safe or unsafe.

                  similar distal sensory (i.e., visual and auditory) capacities.
                  Consumers, however, perceive virtual influencers as having

                  gustatory) capacities. Consequently, when endorsements focus

                  intention toward products and services endorsed by a virtual
                  (vs. human) influencer. The findings further reveal that

                  concise framework for classifying the manifold forms of
                  synchrony along six dimensions: periodicity, discreteness,
                  spatial similarity, directionality, leader–follower dynamics,
                  and observability. We also distill the various proposed
                  functions of interpersonal synchrony into four interconnected
                  functions: reducing complexity and improving understanding,
                  accomplishing joint tasks, strengthening social connection,
                  and influencing partners’ behavior. These functions derive

                  multitude of advertisements incorporating emojis. This
                  research undertook two complementary studies to assess how
                  individuals appraise emotional versus functional
                  advertisements containing emojis, examining outcomes like
                  processing fluency, claim believability, attitude toward the
                  ad, and purchase intention. Study 1 employed a factorial
                  design, resulting in four experimental conditions: emotional
                  ads without emojis, functional ads without emojis, emotional
                  ads with emojis, and functional ads with emojis. Study 2
                  delved deeper, offering a qualitative exploration of consumer
                  perceptions and sentiments concerning emojis in advertising
                  contexts. Grounded in the Emotion as social information
                  theory, results indicated that within the sports drink
                  advertising domain, emotional advertising without emojis led
                  to enhanced ad and brand attitudes, purchase intentions, claim
                  believability, and information processing when contrasted with
                  conditions incorporating emojis.},

  abstract     = {This study examined the effect of nostalgia proneness on the
                  level of achievement of developmental tasks during the later
                  stages of adulthood (generativity and ego integrity) and the
                  indirect effect of nostalgia on ego integrity. The level of
                  nostalgia proneness changes with age and contributes to
                  subjective well-being in old age. We assumed that nostalgia
                  proneness affects generativity and ego integrity. To confirm
                  the causal relationship between nostalgia proneness and
                  achievement of developmental tasks, a longitudinal study was
                  conducted. We conducted an Internet survey twice with 600
                  Japanese adults (aged 20–87). The first and second surveys (T1
                  and T2) were conducted in March 2021 and March 2022,
                  respectively. The questionnaire comprised the Inventory of
                  Psychosocial Balance scale, positive/negative nostalgia
                  proneness scale, and state functions of the nostalgia scale.
                  An autoregressive path model indicated that high and low
                  levels of positive and negative proneness, respectively,
                  predicted ego integrity. The results of the mediation analysis
                  suggested that social connections have an indirect effect on
                  ego integrity and that people who tend to feel positive
                  emotions are less likely to feel negative emotions when they
                  remember nostalgic memories, which leads to a sense of social
                  connection and the acquisition of ego integrity. The findings
                  provide an understanding of the processes through which
                  developmental tasks are facilitated in later adulthood and
                  elucidate the efficacy of psychosocial interventions in older
                  adults.},

                  well-being. The present article examines the link between
                  autonomous goal regulation (the why of goal pursuit) and
                  well-being, considering the role of the basic psychological
                  needs, effort, and goal progress. Three studies were conducted
                  using experience sampling methods in which German-speaking
                  participants (Study 1: N = 207, Study 2: N = 717, Study 3: N =
                  703) completed 1–4 daily questionnaires over 21 consecutive
                  days. Multilevel structural equation models were used to
                  capture the structure of autonomous goal regulation and need
                  fulfillment on the within-person
                  (moment-to-moment/day-to-day), the between-goal, and the
                  between-person levels. Additionally, the links among the
                  degree of relative autonomous goal regulation, need
                  fulfillment, and well-being were investigated on all three
                  levels. Relative autonomous goal regulation was consistently
                  linked to need fulfillment, which in turn was associated with
                  well-being on the within-person level. On the between-goal and
                  between-person levels, results differed slightly between the
                  three studies but overall suggested similar results as on the
                  within-person level. These findings highlight the central role
                  of the why of goal pursuit for individual’s daily well-being.
                  Understanding the link between individual goals and well-being
                  in everyday life may be an important step in helping
                  individuals make better choices about their goals, which in
                  turn could improve their overall well-being. (PsycInfo

                  perceiving that one’s country’s status on the international
                  scene is in decline—predicts increased desire for a strong
                  conservative or progressive leader through greater national
                  nostalgia and collective angst. A pilot study on strong
                  leaders’ speeches from the 2017 French presidential election
                  campaign first revealed that both conservative and progressive
                  strong leaders use the status threat narrative, albeit in
                  another form. In four quantitative surveys conducted across
                  France, Malaysia and Chile, we then found that national status
                  threat predicted increased desire for both conservative and
                  progressive strong leaders. In France and Chile, but not
                  Malaysia, the underlying path was contingent on the type of
                  leader, such that nostalgia predicted increased desire for a
                  conservative but not a progressive strong leader. Although
                  correlational, our data suggest that decline narratives might
                  provide a fertile ground for the desire for diverse forms of

                  generative AI (GenAI) shows potential for using AI for

                  care journey, from accurate emotion recognition to empathetic
                  response, emotional management support, and, finally, the
                  establishment of an emotional connection. Marketing
                  requirements for each of the stages are derived from in-depth
                  interviews with top managers and a survey of chief marketing

                  focused on the high and low thinking processes through which
                  vocal confidence signals (e.g., fast speed, falling
                  intonation, low pitch) can influence attitude change. In
                  contrast, this research examines how the vocal confidence of
                  speakers operates under more moderate elaboration levels,
                  revealing that falling intonation only benefits persuasion
                  under certain circumstances. In three experiments, we show
                  that falling (vs. rising) vocal intonation at the ends of
                  sentences can signal speaker confidence. Under moderate
                  elaboration conditions, falling (vs. rising) vocal intonation
                  increased message processing, bolstering the benefit of strong
                  over weak messages, increasing the proportion of

  abstract     = {PurposeBecause of an increase in consumer awareness and the
                  ease of information dissemination on the Internet, brands have
                  increasingly become the target of online criticism. Several
                  factors affect consumers’ reactions to public criticism
                  against brands that they support. The present study
                  investigated the interactive effects of psychological
                  ownership, agency–communion orientation, and internal
                  attribution on self-threat in the context of such
                  criticism.Design/methodology/approachThree studies were
                  conducted to test several research hypotheses. The
                  psychological ownership, agency–communion orientation, and
                  internal attribution of the participants in this study were
                  manipulated using an experimental scenario. Subsequently, they
                  completed a questionnaire with items used to assess purchase
                  intention, self-threat, and demographic variables and for
                  performing manipulation checks.FindingsWhen a brand is
                  criticized, (1) consumers with high psychological ownership of
                  the brand are likely to buy more of that brand’s products, (2)
                  communion-oriented consumers with high psychological ownership
                  of the brand experience greater self-threat relative to those
                  with low psychological ownership, and (3) agency-oriented
                  consumers experience a consistent level of self-threat
                  regardless of their level of psychological ownership.Research
                  limitations/implicationsBrands should endeavor to enhance
                  consumers’ psychological ownership of the brand to increase
                  their support in times of crisis.Originality/valueThis study
                  investigated how psychological ownership of a brand among
                  consumers affected their reactions when a brand was
                  criticized. The effect of self-threat as a mediating mechanism
                  was also considered. Furthermore, agency and communion
                  orientation were proposed as crucial moderators that should be
                  considered in research on consumer–brand relationships.},

                  have gained notoriety by making fun of their consumers, but is
                  this an effective strategy to build strong consumer
                  relationships? Across eleven (seven pre-registered) studies,
                  using lab data, field data, and a variety of analytical
                  approaches, the current research demonstrates that teasing
                  communication increases consumer engagement with and
                  connection to the brand compared to merely funny or neutral
                  communication. These effects occur because consumers
                  anthropomorphize brands more when they use teasing
                  communication. This leads to greater engagement with brand
                  messages and greater self-brand connection. We also leverage
                  the interpersonal teasing literature to distinguish between
                  prosocial and antisocial teases and highlight an important
                  boundary condition. Specifically, we demonstrate that while
                  prosocial teasing evokes a positive human schema, antisocial
                  teasing, although still anthropomorphic, activates a negative
                  human schema which reduces connection to the brand. As a
                  result, antisocial teases lose their relational advantage over
                  purely funny communication. This work contributes to the
                  streams of research on brand humor, anthropomorphism, and
                  consumer-brand relationships. It also provides actionable
                  implications by demonstrating a novel antecedent to consumer
                  brand connection and the boundaries within which these
                  positive effects are expected to occur.},

  abstract     = {In the highly anticipated Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman
                  takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the
                  two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast,
                  intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more
                  deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the
                  extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and biases—of
                  fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of
                  intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior. The impact
                  of loss aversion and overconfidence on corporate strategies,
                  the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the
                  future, the challenges of properly framing risks at work and
                  at home, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything
                  from playing the stock market to planning the next
                  vacation—each of these can be understood only by knowing how
                  the two systems shape our judgments and decisions. Engaging
                  the reader in a lively conversation about how we think,
                  Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions
                  and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He
                  offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices
                  are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how
                  we can use different techniques to guard against the mental
                  glitches that often get us into trouble. Thinking, Fast and
                  Slow will transform the way you think about thinking.

  abstract     = {OBJECTIVE: To gather the existing evidence on the impact of
                  sit-stand desk-based interventions on working-time and
                  full-day sedentary behavior and compare their impact across
                  different intervention lengths. BACKGROUND: Reducing sedentary
                  behavior is vital for improving office workers' health.
                  Sit-stand desks promote sitting and standing alternation, but
                  understanding their effects outside the workplace is essential
                  for success. METHODS: Studies published between January 2008
                  and January 2024 were searched through electronic databases
                  (PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library). The quality of
                  the studies was assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool for
                  Quantitative Studies of the Effective Public Health Practice
                  Project. RESULTS: Twelve included studies showed that the
                  intervention group experienced average reductions in full-day
                  sedentary behavior of 68.7 min/day at 3 months, 77.7 min/day
                  at 6 months, and 62.1 min/day at 12 months compared to the
                  control group. For working hours sedentary behavior,
                  reductions were observed in the intervention group at 9 weeks
                  (73.0 min/day), 3 months (88.0 min/day), 6 months (80.8
                  min/day), and 12 months (48.0 min/day) relative to the control
                  group. CONCLUSIONS: Sit-stand desk interventions can be
                  effective in helping office workers reduce sedentary behavior
                  in the short, medium, and long-term both at work and
                  throughout the full-day. APPLICATION: Active workstation
                  interventions, including sit-stand desks, educational
                  sessions, and alert software, aim to reduce sedentary behavior
                  among office workers. While sit-stand desks show promise in
                  decreasing sitting time during working hours, their long-term
                  effectiveness and impact beyond the workplace remain
                  uncertain. This review evaluates their effectiveness across
                  different durations, addressing both workplace and full-day
                  impact.},

                  counterpart of forestalgia (i.e., future-focused) marketing
                  has received limited attention. The present research is one of
                  the first to compare the effectiveness of nostalgia and
                  forestalgia focused destination advertising messages in
                  attracting travelers’ destination visit intention. Across
                  three experimental studies based on 665 responses from U.S.
                  travelers, the research finds that forestalgia focused
                  destination ads are more effective in enticing travelers
                  compared to nostalgia focused ones. The findings also reveal a
                  significant mediating role of positive emotions and moderating

                  practice, clear consensus conceptualization of key constructs,
                  like memorable, meaningful, and transformative experiences, is
                  needed. While existing research identifies emotions as the key

                  of the impact and process associated with meaningful

                  existing experiential (i.e., autobiographical) memories, they
                  can extract insight from those memories. If any of the

                  the individuals perceive their experience as meaningful.

                  remains underexplored in existing research. Here, we show that
                  Asian and Black people are often dehumanized differently.
                  Twelve studies spotlight a racial asymmetry in dehumanization
                  using a wide array of methods (experimental, archival, and
                  computational) and data sources (online samples, word
                  embeddings, and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data): Whereas
                  Black people are more often subjected to animalistic
                  dehumanization, Asian people are predominantly subjected to
                  mechanistic dehumanization. We demonstrate this asymmetry from
                  the vantage point of victims (Studies 1a and 1b) and
                  perpetrators (Studies 2a-2d). We further document the
                  prevalence of this asymmetry across diverse domains, from
                  everyday language (Study 3) to perceptions in the realms of
                  romantic relationships (Study 4a), crime rates (Study 4b), and
                  business skills (Study 4c). Finally, we demonstrate the
                  asymmetry's real-world consequences in labor market
                  segregation (Studies 5 and 6). Our findings shed light on the
                  distinct experiences of racism encountered by different racial
                  groups and, more critically, introduce a framework that

                  approaches. Data from 61,585 students across nine countries,
                  drawn from the OECD Social-Emotional Skills Survey, were
                  analyzed (NChina = 7246, NFinland = 5482, NColombia = 13,528,
                  NCanada = 7246, NRussia =6434, NTurkey = 5482, NSouth Korea =

                  social-emotional skills. The results indicated that the Random

                  After controlling for demographic variables, optimism, energy,
                  and stress resistance were identified as the top three
                  social-emotional skills contributing to both subjective

  abstract     = {The concept of trust in artificial intelligence (AI) has been
                  gaining increasing relevance for understanding and shaping
                  human interaction with AI systems. Despite a growing
                  literature, there are disputes as to whether the processes of
                  trust in AI are similar to that of interpersonal trust (i.e.,
                  in fellow humans). The aim of the present article is twofold.
                  First, we provide a systematic test of an integrative model of
                  trust inspired by interpersonal trust research encompassing
                  trust, its antecedents (trustworthiness and trust propensity),
                  and its consequences (intentions to use the AI and willingness
                  to disclose personal information). Second, we investigate the
                  role of AI personalization on trust and trustworthiness,
                  considering both their mean levels and their dynamic
                  relationships. In two pilot studies (N = 313) and one main
                  study (N = 1,001) focusing on AI chatbots, we find that the
                  integrative model of trust is suitable for the study of trust
                  in virtual AI. Perceived trustworthiness of the AI, and more
                  specifically its ability and integrity dimensions, is a
                  significant antecedent of trust and so are anthropomorphism
                  and propensity to trust smart technology. Trust, in turn,
                  leads to greater intentions to use and willingness to disclose
                  information to the AI. The personalized AI chatbot was
                  perceived as more able and benevolent than the impersonal
                  chatbot. It was also more anthropomorphized and led to greater
                  usage intentions, but not to greater trust. Anthropomorphism,
                  not trust, explained the greater intentions to use
                  personalized AI. We discuss implications for research on trust
                  in humans and in automation. (PsycInfo Database Record (c)

                  500 album (4,030 album reviews, 254 artists). Using multilevel

                  experienced across people from various cultures and across the
                  lifespan. Though nostalgia has typically been conceptualized
                  as a mixed emotion, prior research has primarily focused on
                  positive effects. We hypothesized that nostalgia can
                  additionally have certain negative effects. In particular,
                  nostalgia shares certain features with envy, a negative
                  emotion defined as a resentful longing for another person's
                  fortune, luck, possessions, or attributes. We predicted that
                  nostalgia would be positively related to envy and that
                  nostalgia would increase feelings of envy. In two
                  cross-sectional studies (Studies 1 and 2; N = 2,588),
                  nostalgia was positively related to envy between individuals
                  and after controlling for demographics and relevant
                  personality traits. In three daily diary studies (Studies 3-5;
                  N = 298; 3,454 daily reports), daily states of nostalgia were
                  positively related to daily feelings of envy and after
                  controlling for daily negative events. Lagged analyses
                  indicated bidirectional effects, such that nostalgia predicted
                  greater envy on the following day and vice versa. In two
                  experiments (Studies 6 and 7; N = 513), nostalgia increased
                  feelings of envy. This effect was mediated by feelings of
                  regret and envy for a past self, suggesting that nostalgia
                  makes people feel envious of their past self which leads to
                  general feelings of envy. These studies point to a novel
                  bitter effect of nostalgia. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024

                  in the self‐regulation of creative action. First, it traces
                  the conceptual and methodological efforts in developing the
                  construct and describes individual differences in
                  tolerance—intolerance of ambiguity. Then, it examines the
                  empirical studies relating ambiguity tolerance to creative
                  thinking skills, creative performance, motivation for
                  creativity, personality, and creative achievements. The
                  reviewed body of evidence suggests that tolerance of ambiguity
                  strengthens creative motivation, associates with originality,
                  meaning construction, and redefinition skills, and fosters
                  occupational creativity. Third, the paper explores the role of
                  ambiguity tolerance in creative self‐regulation. The
                  conceptual analysis proposes that tolerance of ambiguity is a
                  personal resource to meet the demands of creative work at
                  different levels of complexity—completing a project, pursuing

                  tend to engage in intrinsically motivated exploration and
                  experimentation, be open to the process, and playfully
                  approach their tasks. They can endure the discomfort of
                  recurrent encounters with ambiguity throughout the creative
                  process. Furthermore, they may cope with novel, uncertain,
                  contradictory, and complex settings and experiences that one
                  faces in their lifetime dedication to creativity. This
                  comprehensive conceptual framework combines various research
                  perspectives and integrates the individual, social, and
                  developmental aspects of creative self‐regulation. Although a
                  tentative theoretical construction, it identifies mechanisms
                  and processes related to ambiguity tolerance, whose empirical
                  examination will further support expanding research on
                  creative self‐regulation.},

                  emphasizing its importance alongside traditional outcome
                  uncertainty (risk). It introduces a novel quantitative measure
                  of ambiguity that accurately captures distribution
                  uncertainty. This measure enhances empirical models, yielding
                  more reliable parameter estimates and improving
                  decision-making processes. The study demonstrates the
                  practical value of this ambiguity measure using financial
                  market decision making as an example. The measure helps
                  identify and adjust for uncertainties in underlying
                  distributions, supporting more robust financial models and
                  better risk management. The findings advocate for integrating
                  ambiguity considerations into data analytics models and

                  studying the causes, consequences, and structure of social
                  ties. However, standard self-report measures—for example, as
                  collected through the popular “name-generator” method—do not
                  provide an impartial representation of such ties, be they
                  transfers, interactions, or social relationships. At best,
                  they represent perceptions filtered through the cognitive
                  biases of respondents. Individuals may, for example, report
                  transfers that did not really occur, or forget to mention
                  transfers that really did. The propensity to make such
                  reporting inaccuracies is both an individual-level and
                  item-level characteristic—variable across members of any given
                  group. Past research has highlighted that many network-level
                  properties are highly sensitive to such reporting
                  inaccuracies. However, there remains a dearth of easily
                  deployed statistical tools that account for such biases. To
                  address this issue, we provide a latent network model that
                  allows researchers to jointly estimate parameters measuring
                  both reporting biases and a latent, underlying social network.
                  Building upon past research, we conduct several simulation
                  experiments in which network data are subject to various
                  reporting biases, and find that these reporting biases
                  strongly impact fundamental network properties. These impacts
                  are not adequately remedied using the most frequently deployed
                  approaches for network reconstruction in the social sciences
                  (i.e., treating either the union or the intersection of
                  double-sampled data as the true network), but are
                  appropriately resolved through the use of our latent network
                  models. To make implementation of our models easier for
                  end-users, we provide a fully documented R package, STRAND,

                  previous failures in correcting conspiracy beliefs may be due
                  to counterevidence being insufficiently compelling and
                  tailored. To evaluate this possibility, we leveraged

                  2190 conspiracy believers in personalized evidence-based
                  dialogues with GPT-4 Turbo. The intervention reduced
                  conspiracy belief by ~20\%. The effect remained 2 months
                  later, generalized across a wide range of conspiracy theories,
                  and occurred even among participants with deeply entrenched
                  beliefs. Although the dialogues focused on a single
                  conspiracy, they nonetheless diminished belief in unrelated
                  conspiracies and shifted conspiracy-related behavioral
                  intentions. These findings suggest that many conspiracy theory

  abstract     = {Abstract The constructs of motivation (or needs, motives,
                  etc.) to explain higher-order behavior have burgeoned in
                  psychology. In this article, we critically evaluate such
                  high-level motivation constructs that many researchers define
                  as causal determinants of behavior. We identify a fundamental
                  issue with this predominant view of motivation, which we
                  called the black-box problem. Specifically, high-level
                  motivation constructs have been considered as causally
                  instigating a wide range of higher-order behavior, but this
                  does not explain what they actually are or how behavioral
                  tendencies are generated. The black box problem inevitably
                  makes the construct ill-defined and jeopardizes its
                  theoretical status. To address the problem, we discuss the
                  importance of mental computational processes underlying
                  motivated behavior. Critically, from this perspective,
                  motivation is not a unitary construct that causes a wide range
                  of higher-order behavior --- it is an emergent property that
                  people construe through the regularities of subjective
                  experiences and behavior. The proposed perspective opens new
                  avenues for future theoretical development, i.e., the
                  examination of how motivated behavior is realized through
                  mental computational processes.},

                  all episodes (as of the end of 2019) of eight Netflix-original

                  risk and negative consequences of sex and references to sexual
                  precaution seldomly occurred. “Rape” was the most frequently

                  decision concerning legalization, many fantasy sports
                  operators are now incorporating sports betting into their
                  platforms to capitalize on this opportunity. However, little

                  counter-normatively prefer something nearly complete over
                  something complete. We call this phenomenon the “one-away
                  effect” because we find that when consumers are, for example,
                  one stamp away from completing a punch card loyalty program,
                  they value the card more than a completed card. This is
                  because their valuation of the one-away card is influenced by
                  their anticipation of merely completing the card, which
                  generates its own utility, apart from the card’s end-reward (a
                  free coffee). To wit, the prospective utility of performing
                  the final action that fulfills completion increases consumers’
                  valuation of the one-away card. Our findings suggest that
                  consumers are motivated to complete goals, tasks, and sets not
                  only to obtain their end-rewards, but also because merely
                  completing things is intrinsically motivating and can be a

                  devoted to understanding how individuals manage resource
                  discrepancies. This includes tangible resources – such as
                  money, food, and products – as well as intangible resources –
                  such as time, skills, and social relationships. Resource
                  discrepancies can either be positive – as in the case of
                  having substantial wealth – or negative – as in the case of
                  poverty. Several constructs across the behavioral sciences
                  have been introduced to describe how consumers perceive their
                  various resource discrepancies including, but not limited to,
                  power, social status, scarcity, inequality, and social class.
                  However, little guidance is provided to understand when and
                  why these resource‐based constructs can produce both
                  overlapping and opposing consequences. This conceptual article

                  consumer needs that significantly influenced daily fantasy
                  sports (DFS) consumption. Specifically, we sought to predict
                  DFS participation intention and information search. Existence,
                  relatedness, and growth (ERG) theory and self-determination
                  theory (SDT) served as theoretical inspirations for need
                  selection. The needs included were needs for autonomy,
                  arousal, uniqueness, status, achievement, competence, and
                  relatedness. The results of the current study indicate that
                  autonomy and achievement needs are important for DFS
                  consumers. Additionally, highly involved DFS participants are
                  more likely to be driven by needs competence, while low
                  involvement players showed relatively higher level of needs
                  for arousal and uniqueness drove their DFS participation
                  intention. These results from our model can be used by
                  industry professionals in the DFS space to better understand
                  the consumer needs and develop effective market strategies
                  within daily fantasy sports.},

                  and remember? We answer this question by analyzing how the
                  lexical, semantic, and emotional properties of a slogan’s
                  individual words combine to influence slogan liking and slogan
                  memory. Through a large correlational study with over 800
                  brand slogans, laboratory experiments, a biometric
                  eye-tracking experiment, and a field study, we unearth the
                  word properties that make slogans effective. We predict and
                  find that linguistic properties that make a slogan easier to
                  process (i.e., more fluent) result in slogans that are more
                  likable but less memorable, whereas linguistic properties that
                  reduce processing fluency result in slogans that are less
                  likable but more memorable. Across our multi-method
                  investigation, participants indicated a more favorable
                  attitude toward slogans that are shorter, omit the brand name,
                  and use words that are linguistically frequent, perceptually
                  distinct, and abstract. In contrast, participants were more
                  likely to remember slogans that are longer, include the brand
                  name, and use words that are linguistically infrequent,
                  concrete, and less perceptually distinct. We conclude by
                  offering marketers practical advice into optimal word-choice
                  strategies and delivering actionable guidance for creating
                  slogans that are either likable or memorable.},

                  In this article, we first consider the dominant psychological
                  approach to disasters and its narrow focus on psychopathology
                  (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder). We then review research
                  on a broader approach that has identified heterogeneous,
                  highly replicable trajectories of outcome, the most common
                  being stable mental health or resilience. We review trajectory
                  research for different types of disasters, including the
                  COVID-19 pandemic. Next, we consider correlates of the
                  resilience trajectory and note their paradoxically limited
                  ability to predict future resilient outcomes. Research using
                  machine learning algorithms improved prediction but has not
                  yet illuminated the mechanism behind resilient adaptation. To
                  that end, we propose a more direct psychological explanation
                  for resilience based on research on the motivational and
                  mechanistic components of regulatory flexibility. Finally, we
                  consider how future research might leverage new computational
                  approaches to better capture regulatory flexibility in real
                  time.},

                  conspicuous goods—items that are exclusive and signal wealth
                  and high social standing. Though many factors can drive such
                  conspicuous consumption, the present work looks at an
                  unexplored element: whether consumers find themselves in a
                  dominance versus prestige-based hierarchy. Dominance-based
                  hierarchies encourage consumers to use threatening, assertive,
                  and manipulative behaviors to navigate the hierarchy. In
                  contrast, prestige-based hierarchies encourage consumers to
                  show their talent, skills, and motivation to operate within
                  the hierarchy. The present research reveals how these two main
                  bases of hierarchy shape consumers’ consumption of conspicuous
                  goods. Specifically, dominance, relative to prestige
                  hierarchies, is proposed to foster greater social anxiety,
                  which leads people to seek conspicuous goods as a means of
                  psychological security. Consequently, dominance-based
                  hierarchies are more likely to encourage conspicuous
                  consumption relative to prestige-based hierarchies. Multiple
                  experiments, which utilize real employees’ behaviors,
                  experimental manipulations of hierarchy, as well as
                  incentivize-compatible decisions, reveal that dominance-based
                  hierarchies, relative to prestige-based hierarchies, increase
                  consumers’ preference for conspicuous goods. Moreover,
                  evidence for a psychological mechanism in the form of social
                  anxiety is demonstrated via both mediation and moderation.},

  abstract     = {Why do we act on habit even when we intend to do something
                  else? The answer lies in habit memories, or context-response
                  associations, that form when people repeat rewarding actions
                  in stable contexts. Although habits can form as people pursue
                  goals, once habits develop, the perception of the context
                  directly activates the response in mind. Because habit
                  activation does not depend strongly on motivation, changing
                  intentions has limited impact on habit memory. Instead,
                  successful habit-change interventions directly impact the
                  behavior itself: Along with classic behavior therapy
                  interventions, habits change with (a) reward systems that form
                  new habits, (b) disruption of context cues to forestall
                  activation of the habit in mind, and (c) friction that makes
                  the habitual response difficult and alternatives easier.
                  Despite the strong evidence that habits are activated by
                  contexts, people tend to believe that their own habits are a
                  product of goal pursuit. This subjective reality might also
                  explain why some researchers continue to maintain that habit
                  performance depends on goals.},

               non-scientists alike—who would misuse the science to which he has
               contributed so much. In The Triple Helix, Lewontin the scientist
               and Lewontin the critic come together to provide a concise,
               accessible account of what his work has taught him about biology
               and about its relevance to human affairs. In the process, he
               exposes some of the common and troubling misconceptions that
               misdirect and stall our understanding of biology and
               evolution.The central message of this book is that we will never
               fully understand living things if we continue to think of genes,
               organisms, and environments as separate entities, each with its
               distinct role to play in the history and operation of organic
               processes. Here Lewontin shows that an organism is a unique
               consequence of both genes and environment, of both internal and
               external features. Rejecting the notion that genes determine the
               organism, which then adapts to the environment, he explains that
               organisms, influenced in their development by their
               circumstances, in turn create, modify, and choose the environment
               in which they live.The Triple Helix is vintage Lewontin:
               brilliant, eloquent, passionate, and deeply critical. But it is
               neither a manifesto for a radical new methodology nor a brief for
               a new theory. It is instead a primer on the complexity of
               biological processes, a reminder to all of us that living things
               are never as simple as they may seem.},

                  influencers (VIs) as endorsers for their social media
                  campaigns, yet they often lack awareness of the risks and
                  opportunities involved. VIs are AI‐generated, and visually
                  presented as an interactive, real‐time animated entity in a
                  digital environment. Grounding on the uncanny valley theory,
                  this study investigates how the anthropomorphism of VIs
                  influences consumer behavior. Through two experimental
                  studies, we investigate the effect of a VI's level of
                  anthropomorphism on consumer intentions, revealing the
                  mediating role of uncanniness. Specifically, we find that
                  highly anthropomorphized VIs may elicit a greater sense of
                  uncanniness among consumers. Interestingly, the second study
                  unveils that, in the presence of social cues, the influence of
                  anthropomorphism on uncanniness is attenuated. From a
                  theoretical perspective, these findings contribute to the
                  existing literature on the uncanny valley theory and reveal
                  the role of social cues in mitigating consumers' sense of
                  uncanniness. Alongside this, it offers practical insights for
                  practitioners navigating the complexities of managing VIs in

                  psychological science. However, the nature of explanation and
                  the processes by which we evaluate whether a theory explains a
                  phenomenon are often unclear. Consequently, it is often
                  unknown whether a given psychological theory indeed explains a
                  phenomenon. We address this shortcoming by proposing a
                  productive account of explanation: a theory explains a
                  phenomenon to some degree if and only if a formal model of the
                  theory produces the statistical pattern representing the
                  phenomenon. Using this account, we outline a workable
                  methodology of explanation: (a) explicating a verbal theory
                  into a formal model, (b) representing phenomena as statistical
                  patterns in data, and (c) assessing whether the formal model
                  produces these statistical patterns. In addition, we provide
                  three major criteria for evaluating the goodness of an
                  explanation (precision, robustness, and empirical relevance),
                  and examine some cases of explanatory breakdowns. Finally, we
                  situate our framework within existing theories of explanation
                  from philosophy of science and discuss how our approach
                  contributes to constructing and developing better

               might lead us to think of artists as solitary visionaries, the
               creative process is profoundly influenced by social interactions
               even when artists work alone. Sociologist Hannah Wohl draws on
               more than one hundred interviews and two years of ethnographic
               research in the New York contemporary art market to develop a
               rich sociological perspective of creativity. From inside the
               studio, we see how artists experiment with new ideas and decide
               which works to abandon, destroy, put into storage, or exhibit.
               Wohl then transports readers into the art world, where we
               discover how artists’ understandings of their work are shaped
               through interactions in studio visits, galleries, international
               art fairs, and collectors’ homes. Bound by Creativity reveals how
               artists develop conceptions of their distinctive creative visions
               through experimentation and social interactions. Ultimately, we
               come to appreciate how judgment is integral to the creative
               process, both resulting in the creation of original works while
               also limiting an artist’s ability to break new ground. Exploring
               creativity through the lens of judgment sheds new light on the
               production of cultural objects, markets, and prestige.},

                  succeeding in the modern world. Numerous creativity training
                  programs have been developed, and several meta-analyses have
                  attempted to summarize the effectiveness of these programs and
                  identify the features influencing their impact. Unfortunately,
                  previous meta-analyses share a number of limitations, most
                  notably overlooking the potentially strong impact of
                  publication bias and the influence of study quality on effect
                  sizes. We undertook a meta-analysis of 169 creativity training
                  studies across 5 decades (844 effect sizes, the largest
                  meta-analysis of creativity training to date), including a
                  substantial number of unpublished studies (48 studies; 262
                  effect sizes). We employed a range of statistical methods to
                  detect and adjust for publication bias and evaluated the
                  robustness of the evidence in the field. In line with previous
                  meta-analyses, we found a moderate training effect (0.53 SDs;
                  unadjusted for publication bias). Critically, we observed
                  converging evidence consistent with strong publication bias.
                  All adjustment methods considerably lowered our original
                  estimate (adjusted estimates ranged from 0.29 to 0.32 SDs).
                  This severe bias casts doubt on the representativeness of the
                  published literature in the field and on the conclusions of
                  previous meta-analyses. Our analysis also revealed a high
                  prevalence of methodological shortcomings in creativity
                  training studies (likely to have inflated our average effect),
                  and little signs of methodological improvement over time—a
                  situation that limits the usefulness of this body of work. We
                  conclude by presenting implications and recommendations for
                  researchers and practitioners, and we propose an agenda for
                  future research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all

                  research (k = 120) on the antecedents and effects of
                  parasocial relationships (PSRs). In line with contemporary
                  theorization of PSRs as an extension of, rather than as a
                  substitution for social relationships, the meta-analysis does
                  not find a significant relationship between social
                  deficiencies and PSRs. PSRs are also strongly correlated with
                  factors that facilitate interpersonal bonds (e.g., homophily),
                  other forms of involvement (e.g., identification,
                  transportation), and persuasive outcomes. Furthermore, the

                  and parasocial interactions (PSIs) revealing only a moderate

                  inspiration from biological episodic memory. Here, we ask how
                  these ‘episodic-inspired’ AI systems might inform our
                  understanding of biological episodic memory. We discuss work
                  showing that these systems implement some key features of
                  episodic memory while differing in important respects and
                  appear to enjoy behavioural advantages in the domains of
                  strategic decision-making, fast learning, navigation,
                  exploration and acting over temporal distance. We propose that
                  these systems could be used to evaluate competing theories of
                  episodic memory’s operations and function. However, further
                  work is needed to validate them as models of episodic memory
                  and isolate the contributions of their memory systems to their
                  behaviour. More immediately, we propose that these systems
                  have a role to play in directing episodic memory research by
                  highlighting novel or neglected hypotheses as pursuit-worthy.
                  In this vein, we propose that the evidence reviewed here
                  highlights two pursuit-worthy hypotheses about episodic
                  memory’s function: that it plays a role in planning that is
                  independent of future-oriented simulation, and that it is
                  adaptive in virtue of its contributions to fast learning in
                  novel, sparse-reward environments. This article is part of the

  abstract     = {Ever since Tulving’s influential 1985 article ‘Memory and
                  consciousness’, it has become traditional to think of
                  autonoetic consciousness as necessary for episodic memory.
                  This paper questions this claim. Specifically, it argues that
                  the construct of autonoetic consciousness lacks validity and
                  that, even if it was valid, it would still not be necessary
                  for episodic memory. The paper ends with a proposal to go back
                  to a functional/computational characterization of episodic
                  memory in which its characteristic phenomenology is a
                  contingent feature of the retrieval process and, as a result,
                  open to empirical scrutiny. The proposal also dovetails with
                  recent taxonomies of memory that are independent of conscious
                  awareness and suggests strategies to evaluate within- and
                  between-individual variability in the conscious experience of
                  episodic memories in human and non-human agents. This article
                  is part of the theme issue ‘Elements of episodic memory:

                  cared for, and attended to by important others and is one of
                  the most popular constructs in the psychological canon. This
                  project synthesized data from 60 meta-analyses, which included
                  over 2,700 studies and 2.1 million participants, to evaluate
                  the association of social support with psychological
                  adjustment. Results from a second-order meta-analysis
                  indicated that, overall, social support yielded a robust
                  association with psychological adjustment, r = .24, 95\% CI
                  [.22, .26]. Effects of social support were detectable across
                  several outcome categories (mental health, psychological
                  traits, educational outcomes, workplace outcomes), specific
                  outcomes (depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, stress,
                  burnout), and sources of support (friends, family, peers,
                  teachers, coworkers, supervisors), and were detectable across
                  age and cultural groups. However, perceived support was more
                  strongly associated with psychological adjustment than
                  received support. Furthermore, social support effects were
                  larger when examining unhealthy samples, well-validated
                  scales, and cross-sectional studies. Finally, effects were
                  less pronounced in six meta-analyses that controlled for

                  i.e., seek out pro-attitudinal media after preferred candidate

                  failure (CORF; i.e., cut off ties with their party after a
                  loss by decreasing their use of pro-attitudinal media). We
                  also examine whether individuals whose candidate lost use
                  pro-attitudinal media to repair their identity, or engage in

  abstract     = {Emotion regulation is important for psychological health and
                  can be achieved by implementing various strategies. How one
                  regulates emotions is critical for maximizing psychological
                  health. Few studies, however, tested the psychological
                  correlates of different emotion regulation strategies across
                  multiple cultures. In a preregistered cross-cultural study (N
                  = 3,960, 19 countries), conducted during the COVID-19
                  pandemic, we assessed associations between the use of seven
                  emotion regulation strategies (situation selection,
                  distraction, rumination, cognitive reappraisal, acceptance,
                  expressive suppression, and emotional support seeking) and
                  four indices of psychological health (life satisfaction,
                  depressive symptoms, perceived stress, and loneliness). Model
                  comparisons based on Bayesian information criteria provided
                  support for cultural differences in 36\% of associations, with
                  very strong support for differences in 18\% of associations.
                  Strategies that were linked to worse psychological health in
                  individualist countries (e.g., rumination, expressive
                  suppression) were unrelated or linked to better psychological
                  health in collectivist countries. Cultural differences in
                  associations with psychological health were most prominent for
                  expressive suppression and rumination and also found for
                  distraction and acceptance. In addition, we found evidence for
                  cultural similarities in 46\% of associations between
                  strategies and psychological health, but none of this evidence
                  was very strong. Cultural similarities were most prominent in
                  associations of psychological health with emotional support
                  seeking. These findings highlight the importance of
                  considering the cultural context to understand how individuals
                  from diverse backgrounds manage unpleasant emotions. (PsycInfo

                  change how people think about goal success: Thinking about
                  goal success as (a) moving away from the old goal-unattained
                  state; (b) arriving at the new goal-attained state; or (c) a
                  transformation from the old to the new state. We review prior
                  literature and new empirical findings and conclude that a
                  transformation mindset leads to the highest feeling of
                  authenticity and the lowest feeling of fragility after
                  successfully attaining a goal. Importantly, this heightened
                  feeling of authenticity and decreased sense of fragility
                  contribute to positive social and individual learning
                  behaviors, such as a greater desire to share goal-relevant
                  information with others and interest in goal-maintenance
                  behaviors. We end by underscoring the implications of

                  y el alto nivel de Conciencia están relacionados con la

                  el tamaño pequeño y la heterogeneidad de estas relaciones se
                  deben a que los rasgos de personalidad se influyen entre sí,

                  amplios, contienen una variación más específica relevante para
                  la PA. Métodos: Los participantes fueron hombres y mujeres
                  inscritos en el “Alumni Heart Study” de la Universidad de
                  Carolina del Norte que completaron el Inventario de
                  Personalidad NEO Revisado (NEO-PI-R, por sus siglas en inglés)
                  e informaron su actividad promedio del último mes en una
                  escala de 8 puntos. En el Estudio 1 examinamos las
                  correlaciones prospectivas entre los cinco dominios NEO-PI-R y
                  la PA. En el Estudio 2 y el Estudio 3 utilizamos regresión
                  logística multinomial para examinar las asociaciones entre la
                  PA y las combinaciones de pares de rasgos (estilos de
                  personalidad) controlando la edad, el sexo, el rendimiento
                  educativo, el estado civil y la depresión. Resultados: El
                  Estudio 1 reveló que un menor Neuroticismo (N) y Afabilidad
                  (A) y un mayor nivel de Conciencia (C) predijeron más PA. El
                  Estudio 2 y el Estudio 3 encontraron que la combinación de
                  alta Extraversión (E) y alta Apertura (O, por sus siglas en
                  inglés) estaba relacionada con una mayor PA, que las
                  combinaciones de baja E y alta A o baja C estaban relacionadas
                  con una PA más baja y que la faceta de actividad (E4) de E fue
                  en gran parte responsable de las asociaciones E—PA.
                  Conclusiones: Los rasgos de personalidad no operan de forma
                  aislada. Pueden influir en cómo se expresan otros rasgos y
                  dichos efectos no aditivos pueden afectar la PA. La evaluación
                  de los estilos de personalidad podría ayudar a identificar a
                  las personas en riesgo de evitar la actividad física y puede
                  ser útil para desarrollar intervenciones personalizadas.

                  high conscientiousness are related to physical activity (PA).
                  We tested whether the small size and heterogeneity of these
                  relationships result because personality traits influence one
                  another as well as because some narrow facets rather than the
                  broad domains contain more specific variance relevant to PA.
                  Method: Participants were men and women enrolled in the
                  University of North Carolina Alumni Heart Study who completed
                  the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R) and reported
                  their past month’s average activity on an 8-point scale. In
                  Study 1, we examined prospective correlations between the five
                  NEO-PI-R domains and PA. In Studies 2 and 3, we used
                  multinomial logistic regression to examine associations
                  between PA and trait pair combinations (personality styles)
                  controlling for age, sex, educational achievement,
                  relationship status, and depression. Results: Study 1 revealed
                  that lower neuroticism (N) and agreeableness (A) and higher
                  conscientiousness (C) predicted more PA. Taken together,
                  Studies 2 and 3 found that the combination of high
                  Extraversion (E) and high openness (O) was related to higher
                  PA and that combinations of low E and high A and low E and low
                  C were related to lower PA. Study 3, which examined the
                  activity facet of E (E4), found that E4 is an important driver
                  of E—PA associations. Conclusions: Personality traits do not
                  operate in isolation. They may influence how other traits are
                  expressed and such nonadditive effects can impact PA.
                  Assessment of personality styles could help to identify
                  individuals at risk for PA avoidance and may be useful for
                  developing personalized interventions. (PsycInfo Database

  abstract     = {Epistemic emotions are hardly ever studied together, making it
                  difficult to predict what features are shared versus unique to
                  each emotion. To address this, we conducted two
                  autobiographical recall experiments. We compared awe,
                  surprise, curiosity, interest, confusion, and boredom in terms
                  of elicitors, subjective experience components, and action
                  tendencies. Ratings were analyzed using network analyses, to
                  describe the central features for the whole group of epistemic
                  emotions. In addition, ratings were compared per emotion, to
                  identify key features for each individual emotion. Results
                  showed that valence, arousal, coping potential, and avoidance
                  are central features of all epistemic emotions. Awe, surprise,
                  and interest were relatively positive emotions, which together
                  with curiosity, were associated with arousal, high coping
                  potential, and approach. Confusion and boredom were relatively
                  negative emotions, which were associated with low arousal, low
                  coping potential, and avoidance. Further analyses revealed
                  unique features of (groups of) emotions. For example, awe was
                  associated with exceeded expectancies, while surprise was
                  associated with both exceeded and disconfirmed expectancies.
                  Moreover, curiosity and confusion were associated with having
                  (too) little information, while awe and interest were
                  associated with having sufficient information. All emotions
                  except boredom were associated with exploration, but this was
                  particularly high for curiosity and interest. (PsycInfo

                  social communication essential for social interactions. It is
                  important to understand how anxious individuals perceive their
                  social environments, including emotional expressions,
                  especially with the rising prevalence of anxiety during the
                  COVID-19 pandemic. Anxiety is often associated with an
                  attentional bias for threat-related stimuli, such as angry
                  faces. Yet the mechanisms by which anxiety enhances or impairs
                  two key components of spatial attention—attentional capture
                  and attentional disengagement—to emotional expressions are
                  still unclear. Moreover, positive valence is often ignored in
                  studies of threat-related attention and anxiety, despite the
                  high occurrence of happy faces during everyday social
                  interaction. Here, we investigated the relationship between
                  anxiety, emotional valence, and spatial attention in 574
                  participants across two preregistered studies (data collected
                  in 2021 and 2022; Experiment 1: n = 154, 54.5\% male, Mage =
                  43.5 years; Experiment 2: n = 420, 58\% male, Mage = 36.46
                  years). We found that happy faces capture attention more
                  quickly than angry faces during the visual search experiment
                  and found delayed disengagement from both angry and happy
                  faces over neutral faces during the spatial cueing experiment.
                  We also show that anxiety has a distinct impact on both
                  attentional capture and disengagement of emotional faces.
                  Together, our findings highlight the role of positively
                  valenced stimuli in attracting and holding attention and
                  suggest that anxiety is a critical factor in modulating
                  spatial attention to emotional stimuli. (PsycInfo Database

                  personalization in advertisements on social media affects
                  brand engagement and ad avoidance. Using a preregistered
                  between‐subjects cross‐sectional survey (n = 794), we tested
                  four different moderated mediation models with perceived
                  creepiness and perceived relevance as competing mediating
                  variables, and hedonic and eudaimonic well‐being as moderating
                  variables. Perceived relevance explains the positive effect of
                  perceived personalization on brand engagement and the negative
                  effect on ad avoidance. Moreover, perceived creepiness
                  explains the negative effect of perceived personalization on
                  ad avoidance. Contrary to our hypotheses, we find positive
                  effects of perceived personalization via perceived creepiness
                  on brand engagement and ad avoidance. Then, a qualitative
                  think‐aloud survey (n = 36) shows that participants are
                  accustomed to personalized advertisements and scroll to avoid
                  them unless there is relevant or useful content. Independent
                  of their well‐being, participants are not creeped out because
                  of personalized advertising; however, it does raise their
                  privacy concerns. Finally, the findings of our two studies
                  indicate that advertisers and social media need to
                  particularly consider consumers' negative affective well‐being
                  to effectively deliver personalized advertisements due to the
                  increase in creepiness and/or privacy concerns.},

                  engagement from the perspective of self‐disclosure. Four

                  The results indicated that the authenticity of username and
                  avatar is a crucial determinant of engagement with advertising
                  information. Moreover, social media involvement moderates the

                  and advertising engagement. Social media engagement partially
                  mediates the relationship between the authenticity of username

                  personalities to promote their brands, has exploded in
                  popularity in recent years. One common criterion for selecting
                  an influencer partner is popularity. While some firms
                  collaborate with “mega” influencers with millions of
                  followers, other firms partner with “micro” influencers with
                  only several thousand followers, but who also cost less to
                  sponsor. To quantify this trade-off between popularity and
                  cost, the authors develop a framework for estimating the
                  follower elasticity of impressions (FEI), which measures a
                  video's percentage gain in impressions (i.e., views)
                  corresponding to a percentage increase in the number of
                  followers of its creator. Computing FEI involves estimating
                  the causal effect of an influencer's popularity on the view
                  counts of their videos, which is achieved through a
                  combination of (1) a unique data set collected from TikTok,
                  (2) a representation learning model for quantifying video
                  content, and (3) a machine learning–based causal inference
                  method. The authors find that FEI is always positive,
                  averaging .10, but often nonlinearly related to follower size.
                  They examine the factors that predict variation in these FEI
                  curves and show how firms can use these results to better
                  determine influencer partnerships.},

                  a basic psychological need (on par with, e.g., autonomy,
                  relatedness, and competence). It explores the cognitive,

                  Here, we explore the possibility of backward mental time
                  travel, by asking people to start in the future and return to
                  the present. A series of studies shows that mentally traveling
                  from the future to the present—rather than the present to the
                  future—increases perceived similarity between selves across
                  time by reducing the uncertainty of the destination self. Lab
                  studies and two large-scale experiments indicate that, as an
                  important outcome of this novel intervention, mentally
                  traveling from the future to the present has a small but
                  positive impact, systematically increasing savings intentions
                  and savings behavior.},

                  individuals have greater self-confidence than more introverted
                  ones. However, more introverted people tend to take particular
                  advantage of the distance and asynchrony of digital
                  communication to forge connections, which can increase
                  confidence. Limited research has examined whether specific
                  motivations for texting impact the relationship between
                  introversion/extraversion and self-confidence. Thus, in a
                  sample of 157 emerging adults (Mage = 19.73, SD = 1.5), the
                  current study aimed to examine how texting to escape versus
                  texting to express oneself might moderate the association
                  between introversion/extraversion and self-confidence in one’s
                  identity. Contrary to hypotheses, findings showed that
                  introversion predicted greater self-confidence, while
                  extraversion predicted lower self-confidence. Express
                  motivations further strengthened the association between
                  introversion and self-confidence; however, escape motivations
                  undermined these positive effects. For individuals who are
                  more extraverted, use of texting to escape buffered against
                  the association with lower self-confidence, while use of
                  texting to express oneself was found to undermine the
                  protective element of escape motivations. These findings align
                  with recent research that questions long-held societal notions
                  about the self-confidence of individuals based on their levels
                  of introversion/extraversion and offer insight into the role

                  or cognitive changes people make to satisfy their
                  psychological needs. This can take place across life domains,
                  including at work, at home, and in broader life goals, though
                  little research exists comprehensively integrating the
                  different crafting types. Psychological needs are one way that
                  these various crafting types are related. Therefore, we
                  conducted a scoping review of the literature on crafting and
                  the satisfaction of autonomy, competence, relatedness, and
                  meaning in life to better understand how these psychological
                  needs relate to or impact the crafting process. We
                  systematically searched four databases and found 134 papers
                  that met the inclusion criteria. We found that autonomy and
                  meaning in life were two psychological needs that were
                  frequently related to the process of crafting and that
                  competence and relatedness were important but less researched.
                  The satisfaction of psychological needs were often an outcome
                  of crafting, though only job crafting consistently measured
                  psychological needs as the antecedent to crafting. We conclude
                  with recommendations for future research and questions to be
                  addressed. This review may be useful for future basic and
                  applied crafting research by better understanding how specific
                  psychological needs relate to the process of crafting and how
                  individuals may proactively shape their needs.},

                  many contexts is to derive enjoyment or utility, it is
                  reasonable to assume that how much people consume a product
                  will primarily be driven by how much they like it. Yet, the
                  current research finds that, although consumers indeed predict
                  that they will consume a greater amount of options they like
                  more, their actual consumption can be surprisingly insensitive
                  to their preferences. Across six experiments, we find that
                  consumers systematically overestimate the extent to which
                  their consumption amount is determined by their preferences.
                  We propose that how much people actually consume is determined
                  by a variety of factors, including transient motivational
                  states (e.g., hunger or boredom), consumption opportunities,
                  and habits. Compared to these factors, however, people’s
                  liking of a product tends to be more salient, better known,
                  and perceived as a more normatively appropriate driver of
                  consumption—leading consumers to focus overly on their
                  preferences when predicting their consumption. We further
                  propose that this prediction error has important implications
                  for consumer welfare, as it can lead to suboptimal inventory
                  decisions (e.g., over-purchasing of favorite products) as well
                  as ineffective self-control strategies (e.g., restricting
                  oneself to mediocre options in order to reduce consumption).},

  abstract   = {INTRODUCTIONThis chapter compares two alternative models of
                physiological regulation. The first model, homeostasis
                (``stability through constancy''), has dominated physiology and
                medicine since Claude Bernard declared, ``All the vital
                mechanisms \dots have only one object -- to preserve constant
                the conditions of \dots the internal environment.'' His dictum
                has been interpreted literally to mean that the purpose of
                physiological regulation is to clamp each internal parameter at
                a ``setpoint'' by sensing errors and correcting them with
                negative feedback (Fig. 1.1; Cannon, 1935). Based on this model,
                physicians reason that when a parameter deviates from its
                setpoint value, some internal mechanism must be broken.
                Consequently, they design therapies to restore the
                ``inappropriate'' value to ``normal.''The homeostasis model has
                contributed immeasurably to the theory and practice of
                scientific medicine, so to criticize it might almost seem
                absurd. Yet all scientific models eventually encounter new facts
                that do not fit, and this is now the case for homeostasis. In
                physiology, evidence accumulates that parameters are not
                constant. Their variations, rather than signifying error, are
                apparently designed to reduce error. In medicine, major diseases
                now rise in prevalence, such as essential hyper-tension and type
                2 diabetes, whose causes the homeostasis model cannot explain.
                For in contrast to the hypertension caused by a constricted
                renal artery and the diabetes caused by immune destruction of
                insulin-secreting cells, these newer disorders present no
                obviously defective mechanism. Treating them with drugs to fix
                low-level mechanisms that are not broken turns out not to work
                particularly well. The chapter expands on each of these
                points.The second model, allostasis (``stability through
                change''), takes virtually the opposite view. It suggests that
                the goal of regulation is not constancy, but rather fitness
                under natural selection. Fitness constrains regulation to be
                efficient, which implies preventing errors and minimizing costs.
                Both needs are best accomplished by using prior information to
                predict demand and then adjusting all parameters to meet it
                (Fig. 1.1).},

  abstract     = {The premise of the standard regulatory model, "homeostasis",
                  is flawed: the goal of regulation is not to preserve constancy
                  of the internal milieu. Rather, it is to continually adjust
                  the milieu to promote survival and reproduction. Regulatory
                  mechanisms need to be efficient, but homeostasis
                  (error-correction by feedback) is inherently inefficient.
                  Thus, although feedbacks are certainly ubiquitous, they could
                  not possibly serve as the primary regulatory mechanism. A
                  newer model, "allostasis", proposes that efficient regulation
                  requires anticipating needs and preparing to satisfy them
                  before they arise. The advantages: (i) errors are reduced in
                  magnitude and frequency; (ii) response capacities of different
                  components are matched -- to prevent bottlenecks and reduce
                  safety factors; (iii) resources are shared between systems to
                  minimize reserve capacities; (iv) errors are remembered and
                  used to reduce future errors. This regulatory strategy
                  requires a dedicated organ, the brain. The brain tracks
                  multitudinous variables and integrates their values with prior
                  knowledge to predict needs and set priorities. The brain
                  coordinates effectors to mobilize resources from modest bodily
                  stores and enforces a system of flexible trade-offs: from each
                  organ according to its ability, to each organ according to its
                  need. The brain also helps regulate the internal milieu by
                  governing anticipatory behavior. Thus, an animal conserves
                  energy by moving to a warmer place - before it cools, and it
                  conserves salt and water by moving to a cooler one before it
                  sweats. The behavioral strategy requires continuously updating
                  a set of specific "shopping lists" that document the growing
                  need for each key component (warmth, food, salt, water). These
                  appetites funnel into a common pathway that employs a "stick"
                  to drive the organism toward filling the need, plus a "carrot"
                  to relax the organism when the need is satisfied. The stick
                  corresponds broadly to the sense of anxiety, and the carrot
                  broadly to the sense of pleasure. This design constrains
                  anxieties to be non-adapting and pleasures to be brief --
                  fast-adapting -- to make way for the next anxiety. The
                  stick/carrot mechanisms evolved early and expanded so that in
                  humans they govern higher level learning and social
                  organization. Correspondingly, the "funnel" widened to allow
                  innumerable activities and experiences to each provide
                  non-adapting anxieties and brief pleasures, their reward
                  values depending partly on the effort expended. But modern
                  life narrows the variety of small pleasures and reduces
                  effort, thereby reducing their reward value and requiring
                  larger portions for equivalent satisfaction - a cycle that
                  generates addictive behaviors. Homeostasis and allostasis
                  locate pathology at different levels. Homeostasis identifies
                  proximate causes; for example, it attributes essential
                  hypertension to excess salt water in too small a vascular
                  reservoir. Thus it directs pharmacotherapy toward reducing
                  salt and water, expanding the reservoir, and blocking
                  feedbacks that would counteract these measures. Allostasis
                  attributes essential hypertension to the brain. Chronically
                  anticipating a need for higher pressure, the brain mobilizes
                  all the low level mechanisms in concert: kidney to retain salt
                  and water, vascular system to tighten, and salt appetite to
                  rise. Correspondingly, allostasis would direct therapy toward
                  higher levels - to reduce demand and increase sense of control
                  -- so that the brain can down-shift its prediction and relax
                  all the low-level mechanisms in concert. For disorders of
                  addiction homeostasis pursues pharmacological treatments:
                  drugs to treat drug addiction, obesity, and other compulsive
                  behaviors. Allostasis suggests broader approaches - such as
                  re-expanding the range of possible pleasures and providing
                  opportunities to expend effort in their pursuit.},

                  different conceptualizations of uncertainty and different
                  methods of coping? To answer these questions we analyzed 102
                  self-reports of decision-making under uncertainty with an
                  inclusive method of classifying conceptualizations of
                  uncertainty and coping mechanisms developed from the
                  decision-making literature. The results showed that decision
                  makers distinguished among three types of uncertainty:
                  inadequate understanding, incomplete information, and
                  undifferentiated alternatives. To these they applied five
                  strategies of coping: reducing uncertainty, assumption-based
                  reasoning, weighing pros and cons of competing alternatives,
                  suppressing uncertainty, and forestalling. Inadequate

                  and context-level predictors of the experience of nostalgia in

                  identified self-selected nostalgic and musically matched
                  nonnostalgic, familiar songs for each individual, using an
                  online survey in 2021. The participants listened to music and
                  indicated feelings of valence and arousal, followed by
                  assessments of affect (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule,
                  Short Form) and personality (Ten-Item Personality Inventory,
                  Brief Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales, and
                  Southampton Nostalgia Scale). Nostalgic songs were rated
                  higher in valence and arousal than familiar, nonnostalgic
                  control songs, and higher in mixed valence in some metrics.
                  Individuals with higher trait-level Trait Nostalgia reported
                  higher nostalgia ratings across nostalgic and control songs.
                  Interactions between context- and person-level factors
                  indicated that personality influenced the felt valence and
                  arousal profile of music-evoked nostalgia, distinct from
                  familiar control music. While some personality types found
                  nostalgic music to make them feel more aroused and positive
                  (those high in care, trait nostalgia, anger), others felt more
                  negative while listening (those high in sadness). Last, we
                  extend the personality profile of a highly nostalgic person;
                  trait-level Trait Nostalgia was associated with care, play,
                  agreeableness, extraversion, and neuroticism. We demonstrate

                  aspects of the human condition. Uncertainty is often
                  associated with negative affect, but in some circumstances, it
                  is associated with positive affect. In this article, we review
                  different explanations for the varying relationship between
                  uncertainty and affect. We identify "mental simulation" as a
                  key process that links uncertainty to affective states. We
                  suggest that people have a propensity to simulate negative
                  outcomes, which result in a propensity toward negative
                  affective responses to uncertainty. We also propose the
                  existence of several important moderators of this process,
                  including context and individual differences such as
                  uncertainty tolerance, as well as emotion regulation
                  strategies. Finally, we highlight important knowledge gaps and
                  promising areas for future research, both empirical and
                  conceptual, to further elucidate the relationship between

                  change in self-reported mindfulness and perceived stress in
                  participants who completed an 8-week course in
                  mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR). METHOD:
                  Participants were 87 adults with problematic levels of stress
                  related to chronic illness, chronic pain, and other life
                  circumstances (mean age = 49 years, 67\% female) participating
                  in MBSR in an academic medical center. They completed weekly
                  self-report assessments of mindfulness skills and perceived
                  stress. It was hypothesized that significant improvement in
                  mindfulness skills would precede significant change in stress.
                  RESULTS: Mindfulness skills and perceived stress both changed
                  significantly from pretreatment to posttreatment. Significant
                  increases in mindfulness occurred by the second week of the
                  program, whereas significant improvements in perceived stress
                  did not occur until week 4. Extent of change in mindfulness
                  skills during the first three weeks predicted change in
                  perceived stress over the course of the intervention.
                  CONCLUSIONS: Evidence that changes in mindfulness precede
                  changes in perceived stress in a standard MBSR course is
                  consistent with previous studies suggesting that improvements
                  in mindfulness skills may mediate the effects of mindfulness
                  training on mental health outcomes.},

                  properties of the mindfulness questionnaires were examined,

                  relationships with other variables. Factor analyses of the
                  combined pool of items from the mindfulness questionnaires
                  suggested that collectively they contain five clear,
                  interpretable facets of mindfulness. Hierarchical confirmatory
                  factor analyses suggested that at least four of the identified

                  that the factor structure of mindfulness may vary with

                  vividness, visual imagery, scene, narrative coherence,
                  life-story relevance, and rehearsal. Desirable psychometric

                  one process involved in the genesis of nostalgia. Whereas
                  nostalgia refers to an emotional reflection upon past
                  experiences, savouring is a process in which individuals
                  deeply attend to and consciously capture a present experience
                  for subsequent reflection. Thus, having savoured an experience
                  may increase the likelihood that it will later be reflected
                  upon nostalgically. Additionally, to examine how cognitive and
                  emotional processes are linked across time, we tested whether
                  nostalgia for a previously savoured experience predicts
                  optimism for the future. Retrospective reports of having
                  savoured a positive event were associated with greater
                  nostalgia for the event (Study 1). Retrospective reports of
                  savouring a time period (college) were associated with greater
                  nostalgia for that time period when participants were in a
                  setting (alumni reunion event) that prompted thoughts of the
                  time period (Study 2). Savouring an experience predicted
                  nostalgia for the experience 4–9 months later (Study 3).
                  Additionally, nostalgia was associated with greater optimism
                  (Studies 2-3). Thus, savouring provides a foundation for
                  nostalgic memories and an ensuing optimism.},

                  It is a key component of worry, state anxiety, and related
                  anxiety pathologies. The 27-item Intolerance of Uncertainty
                  Scale (IUS) was developed to measure intolerance of
                  uncertainty. Previous psychometric analyses of the IUS have
                  suggested both four- and five-factor models. High inter-item
                  correlations, factor instability, and previous theoretical

  abstract     = {OBJECTIVE: Mindfulness and pain catastrophizing are important
                  constructs in pain research, and there are theoretical reasons
                  for suspecting that measures of the 2 constructs should be
                  related in predictable ways. The present study investigated
                  the association of pain catastrophizing (Pain Catastrophizing
                  Scale) with mindfulness (Five Facet Mindfulness
                  Questionnaire). The Penn State Worry Questionnaire was
                  included to control for confounding of worry; the influence of
                  demographics was explored. METHODS: The participants were 214
                  undergraduates, who were administered questionnaires via the
                  Internet. Analyses assessed relationships after correcting for
                  attenuation. RESULTS: The mindfulness scales had
                  intercorrelations with catastrophizing ranging from -0.23 to
                  0.13; the Non-Judging, Non-Reactivity, and Acting with
                  Awareness mindfulness scales correlated significantly with
                  catastrophizing. However, worry was better correlated (r=0.35)
                  with catastrophizing, and the mindfulness scales were not
                  significantly related to catastrophizing after controlling for
                  worry. Mindfulness scales were significant predictors
                  (P=0.018) of catastrophizing scores in a single-indicator
                  latent variable analysis, and 1 mindfulness scale
                  (Non-Reactivity) contributed uniquely (P=0.006) to prediction.
                  None of the mindfulness scales significantly predicted
                  catastrophizing scores when worry was controlled, but the path
                  from worry to catastrophizing was significant (P=0.048). Sex
                  differences in catastrophizing scores were explained by sex
                  differences on the worry scale (P<0.001). DISCUSSION: These
                  findings suggest that it is important to assess more general
                  cognitive-emotional constructs, such as worry, when making
                  inferences about the influence of mindfulness or changes in
                  mindfulness upon catastrophic thinking in response to pain.},

                  (e.g., memories, relationships, happiness) or peripheral
                  (e.g., daydreaming, regret, loneliness). Central (as compared
                  with peripheral) features were more often recalled and falsely

                  literature search using PubMed, PsycINFO, the Cochrane
                  Library, and manual searches. Our meta-analysis was based on
                  39 studies totaling 1,140 participants receiving

                  cancer, generalized anxiety disorder, depression, and other

                  estimates suggest that mindfulness-based therapy was
                  moderately effective for improving anxiety (Hedges's g = 0.63)
                  and mood symptoms (Hedges's g = 0.59) from pre- to
                  posttreatment in the overall sample. In patients with anxiety

                  were robust, were unrelated to publication year or number of
                  treatment sessions, and were maintained over follow-up.
                  CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that mindfulness-based

                  Nostalgia is a highly social emotion that bolsters perceptions
                  of connectedness with others. In 6 studies, we investigated
                  whether nostalgia reduces individuals' general reluctance to
                  reach out to others for help by virtue of its capacity to
                  strengthen social connectedness (i.e., a sense of acceptance
                  and support). In a preliminary study, we measured nostalgia, 6
                  comparator emotions, and help seeking. Nostalgia predicted
                  help seeking, independently of the comparator emotions. In
                  Experiments 1 through 4, we induced nostalgia (vs. control)

                  Nostalgia increased self-reported help seeking (Experiments 1

                  these effects were mediated by social connectedness
                  (Experiments 2 and 4). In Experiment 5, we manipulated the
                  social content of nostalgic reflections and measured
                  help-seeking behavior. Nostalgia pertaining to social (but not
                  to nonsocial) past events increased help seeking. In all,
                  nostalgia is a resource that facilitates help seeking by

                  demonstrates that nostalgizing can promote well-being, but
                  nostalgic reflection is not often discussed among other

                  well-being (positive and negative affect, life satisfaction,
                  subjective vitality, and eudaimonic well-being) over time.
                  After 3 weeks, participants who engaged in nostalgic
                  reflection had higher well-being than those who engaged in
                  ordinary reflection. After 6 weeks, and at a 1-month
                  follow-up, the positive effect of nostalgic reflection was
                  reserved for those who were high on dispositional nostalgia
                  (i.e., well-suited to the nostalgia intervention). However, at
                  these time points, nostalgic reflection was associated with
                  lower well-being among those particularly low on dispositional

                  to mechanisms that drive nostalgia's positive influence on

                  temporary well-being benefits for most (out to 3 weeks) and,
                  beyond that, is a matter of fit-beneficial or adverse to those

                  accepting stance towards experience moderates the relationship
                  between self-esteem and depression. In a sample of 216
                  undergraduate students, self-esteem was assessed with the
                  Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1965), acceptance with
                  the ‘accept without judgment’ subscale of the Kentucky
                  Inventory of Mindfulness Skills (Baer, Smith, \& Allen, 2004),
                  and depressive symptoms with the Beck Depression Inventory
                  (Beck \& Steer, 1987). Results showed that non-judgmental
                  acceptance moderates the relationship between self-esteem and
                  depression. In persons with low mindful acceptance,
                  self-esteem was much more closely associated with depression

                  however, has highlighted positive effects of nostalgia,
                  suggesting it is a predominantly positive emotion. When
                  measured as an individual difference, nostalgia-prone
                  individuals report greater meaning in life and approach
                  temperament. When manipulated in an experimental paradigm,
                  nostalgia increases meaning in life, self-esteem, optimism,
                  and positive affect. These positive effects may result from
                  the specific experimental procedures used and little is known
                  about daily experiences that covary with nostalgia. To address
                  this gap, we aimed to measure nostalgia in ecologically valid
                  contexts. We created and validated the Personal Inventory of
                  Nostalgic Experiences (PINE) scale (Studies 1a-1d) to assess
                  both trait and state-based nostalgic experiences. When
                  measured as an individual difference, the nomological net was
                  generally negative (Study 2). When measured in daily life
                  (Studies 3 and 4), nostalgia as a state variable was
                  negatively related to well-being. Lagged analyses showed that
                  state nostalgia had mixed effects on well-being at a later
                  moment that day and negative effects on well-being on the
                  following day. To reconcile the discrepancies between these
                  studies and the positive effects of nostalgia from previous
                  research, we showed that experimentally induced nostalgic
                  recollections were rated more positively and less negatively
                  than daily experiences of nostalgia (Study 5). These studies
                  show that nostalgia is a mixed emotion; although it may be
                  predominantly positive when nostalgic memories are generated
                  on request, it seems predominantly negative when nostalgia is
                  experienced in the course of everyday life. (PsycINFO Database

                  psychopathology and related risky/impulsive behavior.
                  Ninety-five unselected adults (ages 19-55, 53\% men) recruited
                  from the community completed a measure of intolerance of
                  uncertainty, externalizing traits and problems, and
                  risky/impulsive behavior. Higher levels of intolerance of
                  uncertainty were associated with greater endorsement of
                  externalizing symptoms (e.g., aggression, alcohol/marijuana
                  use, problematic impulsivity) and last-month risky and

                  adaptive emotion regulation strategies and their association

                  are effective for treatment of both psychological and physical
                  symptoms. However, an equally important direction for future
                  research is to investigate questions concerning mechanisms of
                  action underlying mindfulness-based interventions. This
                  theoretical paper proposes a model of mindfulness, in an
                  effort to elucidate potential mechanisms to explain how
                  mindfulness affects positive change. Potential implications
                  and future directions for the empirical study of mechanisms
                  involved in mindfulness are addressed.},

                  mindfulness meditation on executive control. What has been
                  lacking, however, is an understanding of the mechanism
                  underlying this effect. Some theorists have described
                  mindfulness as embodying two facets-present moment awareness
                  and emotional acceptance. Here, we examine how the effect of
                  meditation practice on executive control manifests in the
                  brain, suggesting that emotional acceptance and performance
                  monitoring play important roles. We investigated the effect of
                  meditation practice on executive control and measured the
                  neural correlates of performance monitoring, specifically, the
                  error-related negativity (ERN), a neurophysiological response
                  that occurs within 100 ms of error commission. Meditators and
                  controls completed a Stroop task, during which we recorded ERN
                  amplitudes with electroencephalography. Meditators showed
                  greater executive control (i.e. fewer errors), a higher ERN
                  and more emotional acceptance than controls. Finally,
                  mediation pathway models further revealed that meditation
                  practice relates to greater executive control and that this
                  effect can be accounted for by heightened emotional
                  acceptance, and to a lesser extent, increased brain-based
                  performance monitoring.},

                  years. Despite this, a systematic review of this topic has not
                  been conducted. A systematic review can benefit the field by
                  identifying the terminology and measures used by researchers
                  and by highlighting methodological weaknesses and empirical
                  gaps. We systematically reviewed non-interventional,
                  quantitative papers on DM and psychological health in
                  non-clinical samples published in English up to June 2016,
                  following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
                  and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A literature search was
                  conducted using PsycINFO, PubMED, Medline and Embase, and 93
                  papers met the inclusion criteria. Within these, three main
                  themes emerged, depicting the relationship between DM and
                  psychological health: (1) DM appears to be inversely related
                  to psychopathological symptoms such as depressive symptoms,
                  (2) DM is positively linked to adaptive cognitive processes
                  such as less rumination and pain catastrophizing and (3) DM
                  appears to be associated with better emotional processing and
                  regulation. These themes informed the creation of a taxonomy.
                  We conclude that research has consistently shown a positive
                  relationship between DM and psychological health. Suggestions

                  this theme from the opposite direction, establishing the
                  influence of morality on perceptions of social identity. In
                  three studies, conducted in two cultures, we show that
                  in-group members acting immorally are excluded from the group.
                  Extending this investigation to the overlooked study of
                  out-group-on-out-group behavior, in Studies 2 and 3, we
                  compare perceptions of social inclusion for in-group members
                  following (im)moral behavior toward the in-group with
                  perceptions of out-group members following (im)moral behavior

                  concern preservation and protection of the group, but not
                  individualizing morals, which concern preservation and
                  protection of individual rights. Finally, in Study 3, we

                  in-group superiority by affirming the positive distinctiveness

                  potential in treating post-travel depression is acknowledged,
                  its influence on destination marketing remains understudied.
                  Using mental imagery as a theoretical framework, the
                  experiment involved 547 Taiwanese and international students
                  who utilized domestic flights to satisfy their travel
                  cravings. Comparing three nostalgic emotions previews (videos,
                  360 virtual tours, and VR), to examine varying degrees of
                  immersion. The findings reveal that exposure to VR
                  significantly enhances imagery and strengthens travel

                  emotional clarity would be associated with lower
                  indecisiveness but greater goal pursuit. We also hypothesized
                  that indecisiveness would be associated with less goal pursuit
                  with momentary emotional clarity being a potential moderator
                  of this association. Adults (N = 215, Mage = 44.3)
                  experiencing a range of depression, a disorder characterized
                  by indecisiveness, completed a self-report measure of
                  indecisiveness and 2 weeks of experience sampling assessing
                  momentary emotional clarity, goal pursuit, and negative
                  affect. Momentary emotional clarity showed robust links to
                  lower indecisiveness and greater goal pursuit that were not
                  accounted for by negative affect. We did not observe a link
                  between indecisiveness and goal pursuit. Emotional clarity
                  appears to play a role in motivational and cognitive processes
                  that unfold in daily life. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024

  abstract     = {Academic Abstract Prominent theories of belief and
                  metacognition make different predictions about how people
                  evaluate their biased beliefs. These predictions reflect
                  different assumptions about (a) people’s conscious belief
                  regulation goals and (b) the mechanisms and constraints
                  underlying belief change. I argue that people exhibit
                  heterogeneity in how they evaluate their biased beliefs.
                  Sometimes people are blind to their biases, sometimes people
                  acknowledge and condone them, and sometimes people resent
                  them. The observation that people adopt a variety of
                  “metacognitive positions” toward their beliefs provides
                  insight into people’s belief regulation goals as well as
                  insight into way that belief formation is free and
                  constrained. The way that people relate to their beliefs
                  illuminates why they hold those beliefs. Identifying how
                  someone thinks about their belief is useful for changing their
                  mind. Public Abstract The same belief can be alternatively
                  thought of as rational, careful, unfortunate, or an act of
                  faith. These beliefs about one’s beliefs are called
                  “metacognitive positions.” I review evidence that people hold
                  at least four different metacognitive positions. For each
                  position, I discuss what kinds of cognitive processes
                  generated belief and what role people’s values and preferences
                  played in belief formation. We can learn a lot about someone’s
                  belief based on how they relate to that belief. Learning how
                  someone relates to their belief is useful for identifying the
                  best ways to try to change their mind.},

                  Across four studies ( N = 621), growth mindsets of people were
                  positively associated with intentions to engage in positive
                  interracial contact. In Studies 2–4, in an attempt to explore

                  these manipulations did not robustly predict interracial

                  intentions through self-reported growth mindsets. In Studies
                  3–4, the growth mindset experimental condition also indirectly

                  individuals striving toward a goal end state exhibit greater
                  motivation when their attention is directed to whichever is
                  smaller in size—their accumulated or remaining progress. The
                  result is that, at the beginning of goal pursuit, directing
                  attention to accumulated progress increases goal adherence
                  relative to directing attention to remaining progress (e.g.,
                  20\% completed is more impactful than 80\% remaining).
                  However, with closeness to the goal, directing attention to
                  accumulated progress lessens goal adherence relative to
                  directing attention to remaining progress (e.g., 20\%
                  remaining is more impactful than 80\% completed; studies 1–2).
                  The focus on small areas increases motivation by creating an
                  illusion of fast progress (study 3). Therefore, when
                  individuals wish to prolong goal pursuit and avoid reaching
                  the goal's end state, they slow down goal adherence when their
                  attention is directed to small areas (study 4).},

                  EffectLiteR facilitates a direct integration of latent
                  variables based on structural equation models (SEM). The
                  corresponding framework considers latent interactions and
                  provides various effect estimates for evaluating the
                  differential effectiveness of treatments. In addition, a
                  user-friendly graphical interface customizes the
                  implementation of the complex models. We aim to enable
                  applications of EffectLiteR in more contexts, and therefore
                  generalize the framework for incorporating latent variables
                  measured with categorical indicators. This refers, for
                  instance, to achievement tests in educational large-scale
                  assessments (LSAs), which are typically constructed in the
                  tradition of item response theory (IRT). We review different
                  modeling strategies for incorporating latent variables from
                  IRT models in an effect analysis (i.e., individual score
                  estimates, plausible values, SEM for categorical indicators).
                  The strategies differ in the handling of measurement error
                  and, thus, have different implications for the accuracy and
                  efficiency of causal effect estimates. We describe our
                  extensions of EffectLiteR based on SEM for categorical
                  indicators and illustrate the model specification
                  step-by-step. In addition, we present a hands-on example,
                  where we apply EffectLiteR in LSA data. The practical benefit
                  of using latent variables in comparison to proficiency scores
                  is of special interest in the application and discussion.

                  positive self-presentation doesn’t always guarantee social
                  support. This study examined the relationship between positive
                  and negative fitness self-presentations on social media and
                  the reception of supportive feedback. Additionally, it
                  investigated how social support might influence individuals’
                  self-efficacy, motivation, and participation in physical
                  activities (PA). Participants were fitness app users recruited
                  from a crowdsourcing internet marketplace who had shared their

                  either on applicants’ potential and select on foundational
                  skills (e.g., social skills, math skills) or on their
                  readiness and select on more-advanced skills (e.g., pricing a
                  derivative). The higher (lower) the social trust—people’s
                  trust in their fellow members of society—the more (less)
                  employers are willing to invest in employees and grant them
                  role flexibility. Employers in higher-trust societies are
                  therefore more attentive to applicants’ potential, focusing
                  more on foundational skills than on advanced skills. We
                  empirically test this theory by using a novel dataset of more
                  than 50 million job postings from the 28 European Union
                  countries. We find that the higher a country’s social trust,
                  the more its employers require foundational skills instead of
                  advanced skills. Our identification strategy takes advantage
                  of multinational firms in our sample and uses measures of
                  bilateral (country-to-country) trust to predict job
                  requirements, while including an instrumental variable and
                  fixed effects on country, year, employer, and occupation.

                  the facts, the law, or how the law applies to the facts. The

                  may be insufficient to provide clarity over legal disputes.

                  field of creativity. To shed light on this issue, we conducted
                  a meta‐analysis of cross‐domain correlations based on the
                  Kaufman Domains of Creativity Scale (K‐DOCS). To evaluate the
                  model fit of one general factor versus two factors that
                  encompass the primary K‐DOCS subscales (Scholarly, Everyday,
                  Artistic, Scientific, and Performance), we employed the
                  one‐stage meta‐analytic structural equation modeling (OSMASEM)
                  approach. Poor fit of these models would provide evidence of
                  domain‐specificity, as the proposed models would not
                  outperform the independence model. Our analysis included 45
                  correlation matrices from 30 studies, with a total sample size
                  of 31,136 participants. The results provided support for a
                  general domain of creativity, as well as a two‐factor solution
                  consisting of Arts and Sciences factors. Among the subscales,
                  the highest correlation was found between the Artistic and
                  Performance domains (r = .478), while the smallest correlation
                  was observed between the Everyday and Scientific domains (r =
                  .178). Furthermore, moderator analyses incorporating age and
                  gender revealed that the Scientific and Everyday subscales
                  exhibited a stronger factor load in older participants
                  compared to younger participants. Implications are discussed
                  for research and practice.},

                  traces her own career in motivation, starting with
                  reinforcement learning, moving to attribution theory,
                  continuing with achievement goals, and then focusing on
                  implicit theories or mindsets. Throughout, she and her
                  collaborators have tried to zero in on (and often intervene
                  on) the personal and contextual factors that enhance

                  recently, she has developed an integrative theory that

                  intelligent decision-making. The driving theme throughout her
                  career has been how to harness motivation to promote and

                  contributes to his popularity is his use of language in his
                  lyrics. The current study performed two sets of analyses: (a)
                  to examine linguistic features of Petty’s song lyrics over the
                  course of his songwriting career; and (b) to investigate
                  similarities and differences between Petty’s lyrics and the
                  earlier and contemporaneous lyrics of an artist widely assumed
                  to have influenced him, Bob Dylan. Results of analyses using a
                  standard textual program, Linguistic Inquiry Word Count
                  (LIWC), showed that Petty reduced his references to social
                  relations and reduced his focus on future time orientations
                  over his songwriting career. There were also rises and
                  declines in expressions of authenticity as well as increases
                  in analytical thinking. In analyses comparing Petty to Dylan
                  using a time-lagged approach, Petty’s songs remained shorter
                  in number of words than Dylan’s songs and there was an
                  increase in indicators of analytical thinking in Petty’s later
                  work reaching levels that are characteristic of Dylan’s songs.

                  behaviors. Whereas in recent years the two have been
                  juxtaposed, we suggest that habitual behavior is in fact
                  goal-driven. To support this view, we show that habitual
                  behavior is sensitive to changes in goal properties (reward
                  contingencies), namely goal value and its expectancy of
                  attainment. Whereas adjustment to these properties may be
                  slower for habitual (or overlearned) than for nonhabitual
                  behavior, this is likely due to the routinized (or automatic)
                  nature of such behavior, characterized as it is by reduced
                  attention to its consequences. Furthermore, we show that
                  habitual behavior’s prolonged persistence despite its manifest
                  detachment from the original goal likely stems from its
                  attachment to a different goal. Thus, there is no need to
                  postulate purposeless behavior. The view that habitual
                  behavior is goal-driven offers an integrative account of a
                  considerable body of evidence and is consistent with a

                  set of principles and mechanisms. Many classic theories of
                  personality have united motivation, personality, and
                  development within one framework, and in light of current
                  trends, constructs, and findings, the time seems right for a
                  new kind of integration. Why is this the right time for a new
                  integration? First, personality researchers are increasingly
                  bringing together trait and social-cognitive theories, once
                  considered quite separate approaches. Next, more and more
                  researchers are highlighting the importance of motivational
                  processes in personality. And finally, many more researchers
                  are now studying the development and the developmental
                  trajectory of personality. Capitalizing on these exciting
                  trends, this chapter proposes an integration of
                  social-cognitive and trait theories within a motivational
                  framework and with deep roots in developmental processes. As

                  thinking and serve as a foundation for future theory and
                  research. The current theory begins with needs—three basic
                  needs, present at or near birth, and four later-developing
                  needs that are formed from combinations of the basic needs.

                  goals are and how they influence human experience and
                  behavior. In particular, we address how goals are activated,
                  the characteristics of their operation, and the ways in which
                  they interact with one another. We anchor the framework with a
                  set of definitional assumptions about the structure and
                  content of goals. In support of our framework, we draw
                  primarily on research conducted over the last decade that is
                  characterized by its social-cognitive approach. By adopting
                  this approach to the study of goals we also emphasize the
                  implicit nature of motivation, including the ways in which
                  goals can become activated outside conscious intention and
                  operate according to a variety of implicit mechanisms. This
                  stands in contrast with much of the traditional research on
                  goals, which has focused on the conscious processes involved
                  in setting a goal and striving toward its completion. We
                  organize the chapter into four major parts. We consider in the
                  first part ("What Is a Goal?") a working definition of goals
                  as well as a set of assumptions underlying goal research. We
                  then move onto the second part ("On the Activation of a
                  Goal"), which considers theory and findings on the
                  determinants of goal activation. We discuss in the third part
                  ("On the Operation of a Goal") the various characteristics of
                  active goal operation that involve goal-related knowledge
                  activation, evaluations, and affective experience. In the
                  fourth and final part ("On the Interaction among Goals"), we
                  turn to an arguably more realistic view of goals--one that
                  assumes that people are constantly switching their attention
                  and motivation from goal to goal, depending on a host of
                  situational and personal variables. Any given goal pursuit
                  potentially interferes with other possible pursuits, and thus
                  we examine the special challenges that simultaneous goal
                  pursuits pose and the ways in which interaction and
                  interdependence among goals occur. Our broadest objective in
                  this chapter is to develop a goal framework that both grounds
                  previous work as well as generates new questions and research
                  directions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights

                  development within one framework, using a common set of
                  principles and mechanisms. The theory begins by specifying
                  basic needs and by suggesting how, as people pursue
                  need-fulfilling goals, they build mental representations of
                  their experiences (beliefs, representations of emotions, and
                  representations of action tendencies). I then show how these
                  needs, goals, and representations can serve as the basis of
                  both motivation and personality, and can help to integrate
                  disparate views of personality. The article builds on this
                  framework to provide a new perspective on development,
                  particularly on the forces that propel development and the
                  roles of nature and nurture. I argue throughout that the focus

  abstract     = {Goals and related constructs are ubiquitous in psychological
                  research and span the history of psychology. Research on goals
                  has accumulated sporadically through research programs in
                  cognition, personality, and motivation. Goals are defined as
                  internal representations of desired states. In this article,
                  the authors review the theoretical development of the
                  structure and properties of goals, goal establishment and
                  striving processes, and goal-content taxonomies. They discuss
                  affect as antecedent, consequence, and content of goals and
                  argue for integrating across psychological content areas to
                  study goal-directed cognition and action more efficiently.
                  They emphasize the structural and dynamic aspects of pursuing
                  multiple goals, parallel processing, and the parsimony
                  provided by the goal construct. Finally, they advocate

                  satisfaction, displaying various numeric ratings as well as
                  detailed explanations presented in written form. However,
                  analyzing such data is challenging due to the unstructured
                  nature of text. This article introduces a novel
                  machine-learning method for identifying interpretable key
                  drivers of star ratings from text reviews, which might vary
                  across segments. By adopting the Ising model prior to account
                  for dependence between words, the model simultaneously
                  achieves segmentation, identifies segment-level key topics
                  (i.e., groups of frequently co-occurring words), and estimates
                  the impacts of the selected words on the ratings. The authors
                  first demonstrate that the proposed model successfully
                  identifies segment-specific key drivers of customer
                  satisfaction using illustrative simulated review data. Then,
                  the authors utilize real-world reviews from Yelp for empirical
                  applications. When applied to online reviews of 5,241
                  Arizona-based restaurants, the model identifies three distinct
                  restaurant segments, each characterized by three to five
                  important topics. The model's performance is evaluated against
                  six benchmark models, encompassing various topic models and
                  latent class regression with variable selection. The
                  comparison results emphasize the proposed model's unique
                  advantages in prediction, interpretability, and handling
                  heterogeneity. Additionally, the authors demonstrate the
                  applicability of the model in examining customer segmentation
                  for individual restaurants.},

                  problem, the traditional objective of maximizing the expected
                  total reward can be inappropriate. In this paper, we study a
                  new objective in the classic setup. Given K arms, instead of
                  maximizing the expected total reward from T pulls (the
                  traditional “sum” objective), we consider the vector of total
                  rewards earned from each of the K arms at the end of T pulls
                  and aim to maximize the expected highest total reward across
                  arms (the “max” objective). For this objective, we show that
                  any policy must incur an instance-dependent asymptotic regret
                  of [Formula: see text] (with a higher instance-dependent
                  constant compared with the traditional objective) and a worst
                  case regret of [Formula: see text]. We then design an adaptive
                  explore-then-commit policy featuring exploration based on
                  appropriately tuned confidence bounds on the mean reward and
                  an adaptive stopping criterion, which adapts to the problem
                  difficulty and simultaneously achieves these bounds (up to
                  logarithmic factors). We then generalize our algorithmic
                  insights to the problem of maximizing the expected value of
                  the average total reward of the top m arms with the highest
                  total rewards. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the
                  efficacy of our policies compared with several natural
                  alternatives in practical parameter regimes. We discuss
                  applications of these new objectives to the problem of
                  conditioning an adequate supply of value-providing market

                  between creativity and psychopathology, indicating that mild
                  psychopathology might enhance creative behavior. Moreover,
                  similar brain regions may be implicated in both creativity and
                  psychosis. Although aberrant salience (AS) is often associated
                  with psychotic disorders, it could also enhance creative
                  capabilities. This study assesses salience alterations among
                  healthy individuals, artists, and patients with psychosis to
                  investigate its influence on creativity. Three groups were
                  studied: 196 healthy controls, 50 artists from Florence
                  Academy of Fine Arts, and 84 outpatients with a diagnosis of
                  psychosis. They were assessed with the Aberrant Salience
                  Inventory (ASI). We compared ASI scores among the groups using
                  ANOVA, followed by post‐hoc t‐tests, and adjusted the scores
                  for age, gender, and education through ANCOVA. The ANOVA
                  revealed significant differences in ASI scores among the
                  groups, with artists displaying notably higher ASI scores than
                  both controls and patients. ANCOVA confirmed that group
                  membership was a significant factor influencing ASI scores,
                  while age, gender, and education were not. Additionally,
                  antipsychotic treatment did not significantly impact ASI
                  scores among patients. Rather than an unequivocal marker of
                  pathology, AS might also be interpreted as an anthropological
                  asset, enhancing creative faculties alongside unique
                  perceptual experiences. Education may help individuals in
                  channeling their AS mechanisms through art.},

                  person’s behaviors to their audience’s attitude, their recall
                  of the target’s behaviors is often evaluatively consistent
                  with their audience’s attitude. This audience-congruent recall
                  bias has been explained as the result of the communicators’
                  creation of a shared reality with the audience, which helps
                  communicators to achieve epistemic needs for confident
                  judgments and knowledge. Drawing on the “Relevance Of A
                  Representation” (ROAR) model of cognitive accessibility from
                  motivational truth relevance, we argue that shared reality
                  increases the accessibility of information consistent (vs.
                  inconsistent) with the audience’s attitude. We tested this
                  prediction with a novel reaction time task in three
                  experiments employing the saying-is-believing paradigm. Faster
                  reactions to audience-consistent (vs. audience-inconsistent)
                  information were found for trait information but not for
                  behavioral information. Thus, an audience-congruent
                  accessibility bias emerged at the level at which impressions
                  and judgments of other persons are typically organized.
                  Consistent with a shared-reality account, the
                  audience-consistent accessibility bias correlated with
                  experienced shared reality with the audience about the target
                  person and with epistemic trust in the audience. These
                  findings support the view that the creation of shared reality
                  with an audience triggers a basic cognitive mechanism that
                  facilitates the retrieval of audience-congruent (vs.
                  audience-incongruent) trait information about a target person.

                  hobbies related to music. Our main goal was not only to
                  identify behavioral patterns representing adolescents’
                  engagement with music in leisure time but also to establish
                  their relationship with relevant socio-demographic variables
                  and indicators of well-being and risk behaviors. The sample
                  comprised 1,358 secondary school students (aged 15 and 17).
                  Five behavioral patterns were identified by principal
                  component analysis. Three represent preferences for listening
                  to music and are labeled rebellious, sophisticated, and
                  energetic music preferences, whereas the fourth, following
                  music, represents adolescents’ interest in music-related
                  topics via media and preferences for pop and, to a lesser
                  extent, folk music. The fifth factor, music-making, describes
                  an active commitment to music as an extracurricular activity
                  or hobby. The regression analysis was used to relate extracted
                  leisure patterns not only with adolescents’ gender, age, and
                  attendance at specific schools but also with the parameters of
                  well-being and risk behaviors. The results are discussed in
                  light of previous research in music psychology, leisure
                  studies, and positive psychology. Major implications are
                  related to music as a protective factor in a sensitive period
                  of adolescence and adults’ responsibility not only to cherish
                  but also to cultivate youth’s interest in it.},

                  against psychological strain and safeguard well‐being. This
                  applies to first‐generation migrant populations facing adverse
                  experiences, including prejudice and disconnection from
                  previous identities during host country integration,
                  negatively impacting their well‐being. The importance of
                  social identity also extends to first‐generation migrant
                  descendants, confronting dual‐identity challenges and
                  experiencing exclusion and discrimination despite being native
                  born. Building on the social identity approach to mental
                  health, 20 semi‐structured interviews were conducted to
                  investigate how migrants construct their social identities,
                  their perspective on the challenges and changes they
                  experience in relation to group memberships and ultimately,
                  the influence this has on their psychological well‐being.

                  continuity and gain pathways in first‐generation migrants'
                  successful adjustment and psychological well‐being. For
                  second‐generation migrants, dual‐identity development is
                  especially difficult during adolescence due to social
                  exclusion and discrimination in schools. Even in early
                  adulthood, pressure to maintain heritage identity can lead to
                  negative mental health outcomes over time. The current study

  abstract     = {The question of why music evolved has been contemplated and
                  debated for centuries across multiple disciplines. While many
                  theories have been posited, they still do not fully answer the
                  question of why humans began making music. Adding to the
                  effort to solve this mystery, we propose the socio-affective
                  fiction (SAF) hypothesis. Humans have a unique biological need
                  for emotion regulation strengthening. Simulated emotional
                  situations, like dreams, can help address that need. Immersion
                  is key for such simulations to successfully exercise people's
                  emotions. Therefore, we propose that music evolved as a signal
                  for SAF to increase the immersive potential of storytelling
                  and thereby better exercise people's emotions. In this review,
                  we outline the SAF hypothesis and present cross-disciplinary
                  evidence.},

                  ways, navigating them effectively requires self‐regulatory
                  effort. In this preregistered experiment, we examined whether
                  simple self‐regulation prompts, provided across the stages of
                  the creative process, make the outcomes more creative.
                  Participants (N = 332) engaged in one of three creativity
                  tasks—designing a logo, writing a short story, or preparing a
                  greeting card—and documented their ongoing progress with
                  photos. During the task, half of the participants received
                  prompts tailored to their task progress, encouraging the
                  employment of various self‐regulatory mechanisms (e.g.,
                  uncertainty acceptance, adjusting approach). Consistent with
                  our predictions, promoting a strategic approach throughout the
                  task led participants to develop more creative products than
                  those in the no‐prompt condition. Moreover, we demonstrated
                  two indirect paths behind the prompts' effectiveness: first,
                  via enhancing positive active emotions, and second, through
                  fostering a greater time commitment to the task. On a
                  theoretical level, the proposed prompting approach highlights
                  the advantages of self‐regulatory engagement during creative
                  actions beyond solely idea generation strategies.
                  Methodologically, our study underscores the simplicity of such
                  interventions and their potential broad applicability.},

                  strengthened whenever important outgroups are weakened (e.g.,
                  by losing status or power). It follows that ingroups have
                  little reason to help outgroups facing an existential threat.
                  We challenge this notion by showing that ingroups can also be
                  weakened when relevant comparison outgroups are weakened,
                  which can motivate ingroups to strategically offer help to
                  ensure the outgroups’ survival as a highly relevant comparison
                  target. In three preregistered studies, we showed that an
                  existential threat to an outgroup with high (vs. low) identity
                  relevance affected strategic outgroup helping via two opposing
                  mechanisms. The potential demise of a highly relevant outgroup
                  increased participants’ perceptions of ingroup identity
                  threat, which was positively related to helping. At the same
                  time, the outgroup’s misery evoked schadenfreude, which was
                  negatively related to helping. Our research exemplifies a
                  group’s secret desire for strong outgroups by underlining
                  their importance for identity formation.},

                  corporations, believing that profit-seeking comes at the

                  this belief is not universal; rather, people associate
                  ethicality with an organization’s size. Across nine
                  experiments ( N = 4,796), people stereotyped large companies
                  as less ethical than small companies. This size-ethicality
                  stereotype emerged spontaneously (Study 1), implicitly (Study
                  2), and across industries (Study 3). Moreover, we find this
                  stereotype can be partly explained by perceptions of
                  profit-seeking behavior (Supplementary Studies A and B), and
                  that people construe profit-seeking and its relationship to
                  ethicality differently when considering large and small
                  companies (Study 4). People attribute greater profit-
                  maximizing motives (relative to profit- satisficing motives)
                  to large companies, and these attributions shape their
                  subsequent judgments of ethicality (Study 5; Supplementary

                  promoter) acts as a boundary condition on the effect of

                  often difficult to connect with (diverse) others, and it is
                  unclear how entrepreneurs in these contexts may develop the
                  social ties that previous research has shown to be valuable.
                  We studied this subject matter in Kenya, an ethnically
                  fractionalized society that recently experienced the
                  decentralization of government, which required entrepreneurs
                  to deal with both in‐group and out‐group ethnicities. We
                  conducted an inductive case study of four Nairobi‐based
                  companies and captured the creative tactics that they used to
                  transcend ethnic homophily (by defocusing from ethnicity and
                  reframing the in‐group) while also asserting ethnic homophily
                  (by signaling tribal affiliation and leveraging others'
                  ethnicity). We contribute to a deeper understanding of how and
                  why entrepreneurs in socially contested settings develop
                  social ties.Managerial SummaryEntrepreneurs in socially
                  contested settings rely on social networks to access resources
                  and opportunities. However, it is unclear how entrepreneurs in
                  these settings develop and use these networks. We studied this
                  question in an ethnically fractionalized setting that recently
                  experienced the decentralization of government: Kenya.
                  Entrepreneurs who previously provided information technology
                  (IT) services to the central government had to deal with both
                  own‐tribe and other‐tribe contacts to receive new contracts.
                  We studied four Nairobi‐based IT firms that operated across a
                  variety of counties and analyzed the creative tactics that
                  entrepreneurs in this context use to cross ethnic divides
                  while also working with own‐tribe contacts. This contributes
                  to our collective understanding of how and why entrepreneurs
                  in socially contested settings develop diverse social ties to
                  access resources and opportunities.},

                  tend to have stronger intensity and to last longer. Why is
                  that? This question has occupied thinkers throughout history,
                  and with the use of digital media it is even more pressing
                  today. Historically, attention has mainly focused on processes
                  driven by the way emotions are shared between people via
                  emotional interactions. Although interactions are a major
                  driver of group emotionality, I review empirical findings that
                  suggest that understanding group emotionality requires a
                  broader view that integrates two additional processes: how
                  emotions unfold within the social infrastructure in which they
                  are shared and how these processes are affected by people’s
                  cognition about emotions. I propose to summarize the
                  literature using an infrastructure-cognition-interaction
                  framework that contributes to a broader understanding of group
                  emotionality, which should improve our ability to predict
                  group emotionality and to change these emotions when they are

                  the vaccination-compliance problem, or the delayed response of
                  employees in a firm to wage incentives. The aim of this
                  article is to show the insights that can be gained from using
                  agent-based models (ABMs) to study hysteresis. To build up an
                  intuition about hysteresis, we start with an illustrative
                  example from physics that demonstrates how hysteresis
                  manifests as collective memory. Next, we present examples of
                  hysteresis in psychology and social systems. We then present
                  two simple ABMs of binary decisions—the Ising model and the
                  q-voter model—to explain how hysteresis can be observed in
                  ABMs. Specifically, we show that hysteresis can result from
                  the influence of various external factors present in social
                  systems, such as organizational polices, governmental laws, or
                  mass media campaigns, as well as internal noise associated
                  with random changes in agent decisions. Finally, we clarify
                  the relationship between several closely related concepts such
                  as order–disorder transitions or bifurcation, and we conclude
                  the article with a discussion of the advantages of ABMs.},

                  designed to identify virtuosos within the domain of Korean
                  music (KM) through the lens of current professional performers
                  in KM ( N = 315). Pursuing this aim, we created 45 components
                  structured into the dimensions involving KM virtuosos’
                  musicianship, music performance, and other behavioral features
                  based on musicological and empirical studies of KM. Using
                  exploratory factor analysis (EFA), we generated a single
                  factorial structure of 11 factors: social recognition of
                  virtuoso, informed knowledge of KM, musicality for
                  contemporary KM, individuality, musical communication,
                  musicality for KM, performance proficiency for KM, musical
                  mastery, established virtuosity in KM, collaborative music

                  gaps in our understanding of motivational dynamics within

                  new team motivation model that invokes self‐determination
                  theory (SDT), multilevel theory, emergence processes, and
                  identity construction. Using the conceptualization of
                  motivation offered by SDT, we define team motivation as a
                  collective source of energy driving the direction, intensity,
                  and persistence of team activities. By using SDT to develop
                  the process‐based team motivation emergence model, we describe
                  the role of human psychological needs that are involved in the

                  feedback loop intertwined with a team process feedback loop
                  predict how team members' individual motivations converge and
                  then transform into team‐level motivation through a process of

                  preference for older brands, this research takes a contingent
                  perspective to examine how consumers’ preference for older
                  brands is affected by their expectations of category
                  innovativeness. Results from the analysis of sales data from
                  Amazon and seven experimental studies demonstrate that
                  consumers’ preference for older brands decreases with their
                  expectations of category innovativeness. The rationale is that
                  with expectations of category innovativeness, consumers place
                  less importance on consistency-related brand traits (e.g.,
                  stability, reliability) and more on excitement-related brand
                  traits (e.g., dynamic, adventurous). Because older brands are
                  associated with consistency, preference for older brands
                  diminishes with expectations of category innovativeness.
                  Further, this research identifies two factors that moderate
                  the effects of category innovativeness on preference for older
                  (vs. younger) brands. First, familiarity with the older brand
                  moderates the effect of category innovativeness on brand
                  preferences such that category innovativeness increases
                  preferences for younger brands only when consumers are
                  choosing between unfamiliar brands. Second, consumers’ need
                  for uniqueness reduces the effect of category innovativeness
                  on preferences for younger brands. Together, the findings
                  suggest that the dominance of older brands reduces with
                  expectations of category innovativeness. The findings are
                  important from both theoretical and managerial perspectives.},

                  measures the value of players in the NFL, by position, in
                  terms of generating wins. WAR is a commonly used metric to
                  evaluate individual players in professional baseball and
                  basketball in the United States, but to the best of our
                  knowledge, this is the first study to construct WAR measures
                  for American football. A key challenge in constructing these
                  measures is that individual statistics for many football
                  players are not as well developed as in baseball and
                  basketball. Related to this point, the productivity of
                  individual football players, perhaps more than players in any
                  other major sport, is highly dependent on context. We
                  circumvent issues related to measuring productivity for
                  individual players by constructing WAR measures at the
                  position rather than individual level. The identifying
                  variation that we leverage in our study is generated by
                  arguably exogenous player injuries and suspensions. Using data
                  from three seasons and all 32 NFL teams, we show that the most
                  valuable positions in the NFL are quarterback, wide receiver,
                  tight end/fullback, and offensive tackle. Perhaps our most
                  surprising finding is that positional WAR for all positions on

                  inactive over the course of a season. This variable
                  significantly predicts team performance. Calculating this
                  measure for individual position groups allows me to test for
                  differences in the marginal impact of salary resources across
                  these groups. Results indicate that resources dedicated to
                  offense, in particular to offensive linemen and starting
                  quarterbacks, have the highest marginal impact on team
                  performance. This suggests a market inefficiency where these
                  players were relatively underpaid.},

                  relies on both the creativity of independent content creators
                  and the efficiency of content distribution. By sharing
                  advertising revenue with content creators, these platforms can
                  motivate creators to exert greater effort. Most platforms use
                  recommendation systems to deliver personalized content
                  recommendations to each consumer. As creators’ revenues are
                  contingent on their demand, the demand allocation criteria
                  inherent in the recommendation system can influence their
                  content creation behavior. In this paper, we investigate the
                  influence of a platform’s recommendation system on
                  revenue-sharing plans, content creation, profits, and welfare.
                  Our results show that a platform could benefit by biasing
                  recommendations, that is, recommending content that is not an
                  ideal match to a consumer’s preference, to incentivize
                  creators to produce better-quality content. We refer to this
                  as a biased recommendation strategy. Interestingly, we find
                  that such a biased recommendation strategy may lead to a
                  win-win in which the platform, consumers, and content creators
                  can benefit. Our study also shows that consumers may be worse
                  off when they are more knowledgeable and less dependent on the
                  recommendation system. In addition, the platform, consumers,
                  and creators can benefit when the platform has more accurate
                  information on consumer preferences. This paper was accepted

                  video experiences, and the second explored their effects on
                  subsequent listening outcomes. Separate principal component

                  diversity of ways that advantaged individuals seek to support
                  those who are disadvantaged. We characterize allyship actions
                  as reactive (addressing bias when it occurs) and proactive
                  (fostering positive outcomes such as feelings of inclusion,
                  respect, and capacity), both of which can vary in level of
                  analysis (i.e., targeting oneself, one or a few other
                  individuals, or institutions). We use this framework to
                  profile six productive yet largely independent bodies of
                  social psychological literature on social action and directly
                  compare relative benefits and constraints of different
                  actions. We suggest several future directions for empirical
                  research, using the typology of allyship to understand when,
                  where, and how different forms of allyship might succeed.
                  Public Abstract Despite increased popular and academic
                  interest in the word, people differ in what they believe
                  allyship is and the forms it takes. Viewing allyship as a
                  practice, we introduce a new way (the typology of allyship
                  action) to describe how advantaged individuals seek to support
                  those who are disadvantaged. We characterize allyship actions
                  as reactive (addressing bias when it occurs) and proactive
                  (increasing positive outcomes such as feelings of inclusion,
                  respect, and capacity), both of which can vary in level (i.e.,
                  targeting oneself, one or a few other individuals, or
                  institutions). We use this framework to profile six large yet
                  mostly separate areas of social psychological research on
                  social action and directly compare the relative benefits and
                  limitations of different actions. We suggest several future
                  directions for how the typology of allyship action can help us
                  understand when, where, and how different forms of allyship
                  might succeed.},

                  motivation to succeed and enhanced concern for others.
                  However, in competition, achieving success requires harming
                  others' interests, which demotivates guilt‐prone individuals.
                  Given the prevalence of competition in social and professional
                  life, we examine the relation between guilt proneness, general
                  motivation, and competitive motivation.MethodTwo experiments
                  and two laboratory studies (N = 1735) measured guilt
                  proneness, general motivation, and competitive motivation, and
                  their effects on competitive preferences and choices. Study
                  settings included students' choice of playing a game
                  individually vs. competitively (Study 1), physicians'
                  likelihood to seek residency in medical fields characterized
                  by high competitiveness (Study 2), amateur athletes'
                  preferences between inclusive and win‐oriented team strategies
                  (Study 3), and online workers' evaluations of a hypothetical
                  scenario (Study 4).ResultsGuilt proneness was related
                  positively to general motivation, but negatively to
                  competitive motivation. Guilt proneness, indirectly through
                  lower competitive motivation, predicted a lower likelihood of
                  pursuing competitive paths and preference for non‐competitive
                  strategies. Emphasizing prosocial aspects of competitiveness
                  attenuated these effects.ConclusionsGuilt proneness is related
                  to high general motivation but to a lower desire to win.
                  Guilt‐prone individuals strive for excellence, but through
                  non‐competitive paths, whereas people with lower guilt
                  proneness prefer competing.},

                  shaping the opinions that drive votes, purchases, donations,
                  and other critical offline behavior. Yet, the determinants of
                  opinion change via persuasion in deliberation online remain
                  largely unexplored. Our research examines the persuasive power
                  of ethos—an individual’s “reputation”—using a seven-year panel
                  of over a million debates from an argumentation platform
                  containing explicit indicators of successful persuasion. We
                  identify the causal effect of reputation on persuasion by
                  constructing an instrument for reputation from a measure of
                  past debate competition and by controlling for unstructured
                  argument text using neural models of language in the double
                  machine-learning framework. We find that an individual’s
                  reputation significantly impacts their persuasion rate above
                  and beyond the validity, strength, and presentation of their
                  arguments. In our setting, we find that having 10 additional
                  reputation points causes a 31\% increase in the probability of
                  successful persuasion over the platform average. We also find
                  that the impact of reputation is moderated by characteristics
                  of the argument content, in a manner consistent with heuristic
                  information processing under cognitive overload. We discuss
                  managerial implications for platforms that facilitate
                  deliberative decision making for public and private

                  different intergroup contact activities might influence
                  attitudes via different mechanisms. We investigated whether
                  mediated musical or sports contact improves intergroup
                  attitudes through theoretically derived mediators
                  (interpersonal synchronization, empathy, and humanization).
                  This was accomplished by exposing US respondents to videos
                  featuring Chinese singers or table tennis players. We found
                  support for mediated effects of intergroup musical exposure on
                  prejudice through the mediator humanization. We also examined
                  whether seeing in-group (vs. out-group) members enjoying the
                  out-group performance in the video (a “reaction video”) would
                  improve attitudes via norms-related processes. Sharing the

                  identification with that in-group character, which facilitates
                  modeling of positive intergroup relations. We found that

                  reduced prejudice via norms, but only when people viewed the
                  sports performance. Results are discussed in terms of the

                  have examined which actual behaviours (e.g., verbal content,
                  body language) might explain this association. The current
                  study examined whether observer‐rated dominant behaviours
                  (nonverbal, paraverbal, verbal, and general cues) mediate the
                  relationship between self‐rated extraversion and its facets
                  (assertiveness, sociability, and activity) and other‐rated
                  popularity in zero‐acquaintance settings. In two studies, we
                  analysed data from face‐to‐face (Study 1, N = 124) and virtual
                  (Study 2, N = 291) group interactions where participants were
                  videotaped while performing a task and subsequently rated each

                  Scarcity Scale (PESS), a novel instrument measuring the
                  subjective evaluation and experience of economic scarcity (the
                  feeling of having insufficient financial resources to meet
                  one's needs). We conducted three high‐powered preregistered
                  studies (total N = 1900) to rigorously evaluate the PESS's
                  psychometric properties. In Study 1, we generated a pool of
                  items and used both Principal Component Analysis and
                  Exploratory Factor Analysis to select the most appropriate
                  items. In Study 2, we examined the PESS's construct validity,
                  demonstrating that it measures a distinct construct from
                  related constructs such as subjective social class. In Study
                  3, we examined the PESS's predictive validity, demonstrating
                  that it is a robust predictor of both affective outcomes (e.g.
                  anxiety‐depressive symptoms) and cognitive outcomes (e.g.
                  economic risk‐taking). Critically, we found that the PESS not
                  only has incremental validity over and above income but also
                  has greater predictive utility than income. We also found that
                  the PESS score varies depending on the distance‐to‐pay and has
                  excellent test–retest reliability. Overall, the PESS appears
                  to be a valid and reliable instrument for assessing perceived
                  economic scarcity, and we encourage researchers to use it to
                  better understand the psychological consequences of ‘not
                  having enough’.},

                  dedicated special attention to this phenomenon as it
                  significantly impacts people's lives. Although there is some
                  interest in the idiosyncrasies of stigma in marketing and
                  consumer behavior, the literature investigating such a concept
                  is still fragmented. This systematic literature review
                  addresses the stigma concept in marketing and consumer
                  behavior studies by analyzing 82 articles directly approaching
                  stigma in empirical studies. As to the contributions of our
                  study: (1) it synthesizes the literature on stigma in

                  is a matter of concern. The meta‐analysis generally assessed
                  the effect of collaboration on subsequent individual
                  retrieval, registered on the PROSPERO platform and adhering to
                  the PRISMA guidelines, using the Web of Science, Science
                  Direct, CNKI and WanFang databases with post‐collaborative
                  memory as the main subject, screened studies published up to
                  December 31, 2023, a total of 64 studies with 101 effect
                  sizes, including 13,398 participants from 11 countries.
                  Heterogeneity test, sensitivity analysis, subgroup analysis
                  and meta‐regression analysis were performed on the included
                  studies, while publication bias was assessed. The results
                  found that collaboration improves subsequent individual
                  retrieval memory more than individuals, and collaboration has
                  a moderate facilitating effect on subsequent individual
                  retrieval. Group size, material category, category size,
                  collaboration phase, collaboration approach, task process and
                  test method were among the moderating variables. The study
                  emphasizes the role of collaboration in cognition and
                  demonstrates the post‐collaborative benefits. The conclusions
                  are of value for developing methods to improve individual
                  memory.},

                  of individuals and groups, and these judgments shape people's
                  emotions and behaviors. The present chapter describes the
                  causes and consequences of warmth and competence judgments;
                  how, when and why they determine significant professional and
                  organizational outcomes, such as hiring, employee evaluation,
                  and allocation of tasks and resources. Warmth and competence
                  represent the central dimensions of group stereotypes, the
                  majority of which are ambivalent – characterizing groups as
                  warm but incompetent (e.g., older people, working mothers) or
                  competent but cold (e.g., “model minorities,” female leaders),
                  in turn eliciting ambivalent feelings (i.e., pity and envy,
                  respectively) and actions toward members of those groups.
                  However, through nonverbal behaviors that subtly communicate
                  warmth and competence information, people can manage the
                  impressions they make on colleagues, potential employers, and
                  possible investors. Finally, we discuss important directions
                  for future research, such as investigating the causes and
                  consequences of how organizations and industries are evaluated
                  on warmth and competence.},

                  to the intensity and duration of sunlight and experienced

  abstract     = {Abstract Whether watching a movie, sports game, or musical
                  performance, consumers often seek entertainment experiences
                  that are produced by one or more individuals. And although
                  consumers often witness producers acting spontaneously, little
                  is known about the preference for spontaneity in
                  entertainment. Six studies, including real consumer-relevant
                  decisions and a Facebook field experiment, reveal that
                  consumers prefer spontaneity (vs. planned behavior) across
                  several entertainment contexts, as spontaneous producers seem
                  more authentic than planned producers. At the same time,
                  however, spontaneous actions are also believed to beget
                  lower-quality outcomes, suggesting that consumers generally
                  prefer spontaneity even despite the possibility of reduced
                  quality. Subsequent experiments examine the characteristics of
                  the entertainment context and the producer to provide further
                  insight into how consumers manage the authenticity–quality
                  tradeoff: by shaping when and why spontaneity is associated
                  with increased authenticity and decreased quality
                  expectations, as well as the relative importance of these
                  dimensions, higher-stakes contexts (e.g., when consumers’
                  outcomes are enmeshed with the producer’s), negative
                  inferences about spontaneity (e.g., laziness, lack of
                  concern), and low-competence producers attenuate the effects.
                  Together, this research advances knowledge about spontaneity
                  and authenticity and has implications for those seeking to
                  produce appealing entertainment experiences.},

                  narrative structure of advertisements, a nascent area of
                  research, through the protagonist’s emotional arc progression.
                  Design/methodology/approach The multi-methods approach is
                  used. In Study 1, the authors explore the basic universal
                  emotional arcs through the analysis of narrative
                  advertisements from six key economies. In Studies 2 and 3, the
                  authors experimentally test hypotheses concerning the
                  narrative structure and viewers’ attitudes toward the
                  narrative using representative samples (317 and 193 ads,
                  respectively). Findings The authors identify five broad
                  emotional arcs of the protagonist in audiovisual
                  advertisements. Different emotional arcs are found to induce
                  different attitudes in the audience. Narratives ending in a
                  positive mode and the narrative arcs with higher emotional
                  shifts are more favorably evaluated by the audience. Research
                  limitations/implications The present study is limited to
                  textual stimuli tested in a US population and does not
                  consider protagonist characteristic portrayal. Practical
                  implications Understanding consumer preferences for different
                  emotional arcs can help practitioners to develop more
                  clutter-breaking and relevant advertisements.
                  Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this
                  study is the first to explore the narrative structure theory
                  in the context of advertisements using a positivist approach.},

                  surprisingly few studies have investigated firms’ ability to
                  influence the sentiment of customers’ digital engagement. Many
                  firms track buyers’ offline interactions, design online
                  content to coincide with customers’ experiences, and face
                  varied performance during events, enabling the modification of

                  interaction events in influencing the sentiment of customers’

  abstract     = {Despite longstanding interest in the work-life interplay,
                  little research exists exploring the role of
                  non-work/non-family related stressors (i.e., hassles) on work
                  processes and how individuals may cope with such stressors. In
                  this paper, we test the effects of hassles on
                  counterproductive work behaviors (CWBs). Drawing on the
                  work-home resources model, we propose that the experience of
                  hassles contributes to higher levels of CWBs by depleting
                  energetic resources which leads to emotional exhaustion.
                  Further, we suggest that mindfulness serves as a protective
                  resource that can buffer against engagement in CWBs associated
                  with exhaustion. We employ three studies—first a pilot study
                  using an experience sampling method design ( N = 205) to
                  explore within-person variation in the proposed relationships.
                  We next conduct a construct validation study of the
                  non-work/non-family hassles construct ( N = 293), and then
                  utilize this validated scale in our third study which was a
                  time-lagged, between-person study ( N = 161). Analyses
                  generally support our predictions that the indirect effect of
                  hassles on CWBs through emotional exhaustion is contingent on
                  mindfulness such that it is stronger when individuals are less
                  mindful. Together, these findings suggest that individuals who
                  experience more hassles feel higher levels of exhaustion,
                  making them more susceptible to engaging in negative behaviors
                  at work. Higher levels of mindfulness, however, play a
                  protective role in deterring individuals from acting out their
                  negative feelings in counterproductive ways.},

                  musicians (music performance anxiety) and non-musicians
                  (avoidance of participating in musical experiences). Both
                  anxiety and avoidance are driven by perceptions and
                  attributions about particular stimuli, based on schemas
                  developed via direct and indirect experiences. Most research
                  within music psychology focuses on the views of professional
                  or student musicians. However, little is known about music
                  avoidance in the general population, or their perceptions of
                  music and performance. This article proposes to address this
                  gap by comparing Australian adults’ perceptions toward music
                  making and performance. A total of 116 participants
                  self-identified as musical/non-musical, a
                  musician/non-musician, and a performer/non-performer, then
                  defined various terms and phrases related to music making and
                  performance. Logistic regressions indicated that those with
                  exposure to the music education system were significantly more
                  likely to self-identify as musical, a musician, and a
                  performer. Tests of independence reveal a relationship between
                  self-identification and perceptions of music making,
                  performance, anxiety, and willingness to engage. Possible
                  mechanisms underlying the results of this study are discussed
                  and a conceptual expansion related to music performance

                  However, empirical evidence has shown that awe has mixed
                  effects on meaning in life. The explanations for such
                  complicated results have been limited. To fill this gap, in
                  this research, we aimed to clarify how and when awe
                  contributes to meaning in life. In six studies (N = 1,115), we
                  examined the indirect effect of awe on meaning in life through
                  authentic-self pursuit as well as trait authenticity’s
                  moderating effect on this indirect effect. We consistently
                  found a positive indirect effect of awe on meaning in life via
                  authentic-self pursuit (Studies 1–3 and Study 5), which arised
                  beyond happiness and self-smallness (Studies 2a, 2b, and 3)
                  and also held for awe brought on by a threatening experience
                  (Study 3). Moreover, we found that manipulating authentic-self
                  pursuit improved meaning in life (Study 4). Importantly, the
                  main effect of awe on meaning in life and indirect effect of
                  awe on meaning in life through authentic-self pursuit were
                  significant for those with low to average rather than high
                  trait authenticity (Study 5). These findings facilitate the
                  understanding of awe as a meaning-making emotion. (PsycInfo

                  Although it varies with political leaning and the extent of

                  a research model was established based on the information
                  adoption model. This study collected 2276 influencer
                  recommendation posts from typical Chinese social media
                  influencer marketing platform WeChat Shopping Circle.
                  Text‐mining methods were used to develop measurements from
                  influencer posts, and survey data were collected from 20
                  participants from a large Chinese university to validate
                  measurements. Using negative binomial regression, the
                  empirical study found that the number of consumers who
                  purchase recommended products is determined by the usefulness
                  of IRI, whereby being further affected by content expertise,

                  type of recommended products moderates the relationship
                  between these influencing factors and information usefulness.
                  This study makes contributions by revealing the informational

                  exert effective informational influence for different types of
                  products. It also offers practical implications for the design

                  meaning in life. We tested this hypothesis in five
                  methodologically diverse studies. In Study 1 ( N = 311),
                  nostalgia was positively associated with ritual engagement. In
                  Study 2 ( N = 188), nostalgia promoted ritual engagement, and
                  in Study 3 ( N = 296), it did so over engagement in a neutral
                  task. In Study 4 ( N = 252), nostalgia predicted later ritual
                  engagement but not vice versa, convergent with Studies 2 and
                  3. Furthermore, nostalgia prospectively predicted meaning in
                  life through specific ritualistic behaviors during a
                  traditional festival. Finally, in Study 5 ( N = 166),
                  experimentally manipulated ritual engagement augmented meaning
                  in life. As hypothesized, nostalgia advances ritual

                  positive affective, social, and well-being benefits from
                  engagement with music. However, there is a gap in
                  understanding why people are attracted to such music in the
                  first place, as violently themed music is often considered
                  offensive, disturbing, and repulsive by many nonfans. Recent
                  research has found that morbid curiosity, a fascination with
                  death and threatening situations and phenomena, is associated
                  with the attraction to novel excerpts of music containing
                  violent themes. The present study qualitatively investigated
                  reasons that a sample of predominantly nonfans of violently
                  themed music (N = 96) show attraction to such music, focusing
                  on the role of morbid curiosity. Participants reported the
                  reasons behind their curiosity about 32 novel excerpts of
                  violently themed metal or rap music, containing either music
                  and lyrics or lyrics only. Responses were analyzed using a
                  combination of inductive and deductive content analysis.
                  Results revealed that morbid curiosity emerged as a key theme
                  in the responses to violently themed metal and rap excerpts,
                  while a general desire for more information and context and an
                  appreciation for the music and lyrical elements of the music
                  also emerged as key themes. Findings support the notion that
                  morbid curiosity is a key element to the attraction to
                  violently themed music and may support the development of
                  enjoyment and fandom. We discuss implications for the
                  neurological and evolutionary basis of morbid curiosity and

                  consumer behavior—desiring customized interactions while
                  guarding personal data. We explore how happiness with the
                  internet (HWI) influences users' willingness to disclose
                  personal information on social media, employing social
                  exchange theory as our conceptual framework. Our research
                  develops and tests a conceptual model that investigates the
                  psychological mechanisms driving information‐sharing behaviors
                  on social media, including the moderating roles of trust

                  mediating effect of posting frequency on the relationship

                  utilized among both practitioners and academics. However, the
                  conceptualization of WTP is ambiguous, and this ambiguity is
                  reflected across existing methods of measuring WTP. The
                  authors first present a formal mathematical framework that
                  clarifies WTP as a distributional concept—rather than a single
                  number—constructed as a function of customers, comparisons,
                  and situations. The framework further reveals the operation of
                  two comparative mechanisms, direct and indirect, by which
                  situational factors affect WTP. They then introduce a new
                  method to measure WTP—the comparative method of valuation
                  (CMV)—that, unlike existing methods, is designed to account
                  for the inherently comparative and situational nature of WTP.
                  Across nine studies reported in the article and four
                  additional studies in the Web Appendix, the authors (1)
                  examine differences in results between CMV and choice-based
                  conjoint as well as between CMV and the classic
                  Becker–DeGroot–Marschak methodology, (2) demonstrate that CMV
                  is a valid and reliable measure of WTP, and (3) illustrate
                  applications of CMV to managerial problems. This article
                  offers both conceptual clarity and methodological advances to
                  understanding the construction and measurement of WTP for
                  practitioners and academics alike.},

                  advanced audio analytics to test how various features impact
                  upon viewers. The results show that voice quality is important
                  in developing positive affect; advertisement viewers prefer
                  speakers with quieter voices (less mean intensity) that have a
                  higher level of clarity (higher harmonics-to-noise ratio).
                  This can be explained via the heuristic route of the
                  heuristic-systematic model. Music tempo was found to be
                  important in stimulating reactions from advertisements, with
                  faster music being associated with a higher level of positive
                  affect. The paper concludes with practical and theoretical
                  implications, limitations, and suggestions for future
                  research.},

  abstract     = {AbstractIn recent years, influencer marketing has emerged as a
                  powerful tool for brands to create connections with their
                  target audiences. Naturally, many companies have leaned on
                  human influencers, but the increasing popularity of pet
                  influencers (e.g., dogs and cats) represents a new avenue for
                  brand promotion. This research asks the question: Why and when
                  are pet influencers preferrable to their human counterparts in
                  terms of boosting engagement and purchase intention? Across
                  six experimental studies (N = 1166), we demonstrate that pet
                  influencers lead to higher engagement with the promoted
                  content and willingness to buy the advertised product (Study
                  1) because they are seen as more credible than human
                  influencers (Study 2). Pet influencers are perceived as cuter,
                  which in turn positively affects their credibility (Study 3).
                  Specifically, whimsicality is the cuteness dimension that
                  explains their greater credibility (Study 4). These effects
                  are stronger when the promoted product is pet‐related (Study
                  5) and apply regardless of whether people own a pet (Studies
                  3–5). Finally, a clear cuteness manipulation supports the
                  causal relationship between cuteness and credibility (Study
                  6). These findings affirm that pet influencers shape
                  individuals' responses to promotional social media posts,
                  enhance the field's understanding of the mechanisms that
                  underlie influencer marketing effectiveness, and clarify how
                  to implement more influential social media campaigns.},

                  mostly conducted on samples of homogeneous nationality, the
                  generalizability of the effect across different cultures is
                  unknown. We addressed this gap by conducting a study in 28
                  countries. Based on the notion that attitudes can be shaped by
                  both environmental and ecological factors, we hypothesized
                  that parasite stress can also affect creativity and thus, its
                  potential effects should be controlled for. The results of
                  multilevel analyses showed that, as expected, conservatism was
                  a significant predictor of lower creativity, adjusting for
                  economic status, age, sex, education level, subjective
                  susceptibility to disease, and country-level parasite stress.
                  In addition, most of the variability in creativity was due to
                  individual rather than country-level variance. Our study
                  provides evidence for a weak but significant negative link
                  between conservatism and creativity at the individual level (β

                  connections. People often face a decision between exploring
                  new relationships versus deepening existing ones. This
                  trade-off, known in optimal foraging theory as the
                  exploration–exploitation trade-off, is featured prominently in
                  other disciplines such as animal foraging, learning, and
                  organizational behavior. Many of the framework’s principles
                  can be applied to humans’ choices about their social
                  resources, which we call social exploration/exploitation.
                  Using known principles in the domain of social
                  exploration/exploitation can help social psychologists better
                  understand how and why people choose their relationships,
                  which ultimately affect their health and well-being. In this
                  article, we discuss the costs and benefits of social
                  exploration and social exploitation. We then synthesize known
                  person- and situation-level predictors of social decision
                  making, reframing them in the language of the explore–exploit
                  trade-off. We propose that people explore more when they find
                  it more rewarding and less costly, and when the environment
                  has many opportunities to do so. We conclude by discussing
                  hypotheses generated by applying optimal foraging theory to
                  social decision making. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024

                  difficult goals. When Japanese participants perceived their
                  own goals as unattainable, they were more likely to pursue
                  these goals if they mentally contrasted their desired future

                  computational linguistic approaches to characterize salient
                  features of creative text. We hypothesize that, in addition to
                  semantic diversity, the degree to which a story includes
                  perceptual details, thus transporting the reader to another
                  time and place, would be predictive of creativity.
                  Additionally, we explore the use of generative language models
                  to supplement human data collection and examine the extent to
                  which machine‐generated stories can mimic human creativity. We
                  collect 600 short stories from human participants and GPT‐3,
                  subsequently randomized and assessed on their creative
                  quality. Results indicate that the presence of perceptual
                  details, in conjunction with semantic diversity, is highly
                  predictive of creativity. These results were replicated in an
                  independent sample of stories (n = 120) generated by GPT‐4. We
                  do not observe a significant difference between human and
                  AI‐generated stories in terms of creativity ratings, and we

                  daily lives, often results in hedonic adaptation such as
                  satiation or boredom. In line with a growing body of research
                  exploring methods to alleviate hedonic adaptation, this
                  research proposes and finds that creative thinking can
                  effectively reduce hedonic adaptation. Through five
                  experiments conducted across various consumption contexts
                  (music listening, video watching, photograph viewing, snack
                  eating), we show that creative thinking reduces hedonic
                  adaptation by fostering cognitive flexibility during repeat
                  consumption (e.g., enjoying the same photograph from different
                  aspects across repetitions). Supporting this underlying
                  mechanism, the mitigating effect of creative thinking on
                  hedonic adaptation attenuates when consumers' cognitive
                  flexibility is constrained, or when the product itself
                  possesses sufficient complexity that naturally encourages
                  cognitive flexibility over repetitions. Overall, this research
                  sheds light on how creative thinking helps alleviate hedonic
                  adaptation in repeat consumption, with implications for
                  marketing managers and practitioners.},

                  has been at the forefront of academics' and practitioners'

                  interplay between technology and consumer well‐being has
                  remained tenuous. To address this gap in our understanding of
                  technology's influence on consumer well‐being, this research
                  provides a comprehensive literature review of recent articles
                  published in Psychology \& Marketing. Findings indicate a
                  double‐edged sword where technology has the propensity to not
                  only foster a state of negative well‐being but can also
                  enhance consumers' well‐being. Additionally, a technology
                  well‐being paradox is uncovered whereby technology is used to
                  manage the negative effects of technology use. Accordingly, we
                  introduce the Technology and Consumer Well‐being Paradox Model
                  that incorporates technology's propensity to enhance,
                  diminish, and manage eudaimonic and hedonic consumer

                  Behavioral Control–Desire–Intention relationship within the
                  Model of the Goal‐Directed Behavior. First, it refines
                  Perceived Behavioral Control by adopting the distinction made
                  in the Theory of Planned Behavior literature between
                  Self‐efficacy and Perceived Control. Then, utilizing the
                  Desire‐Intention distinction and the
                  motivation‐opportunity‐ability framework, it reinterprets the
                  model antecedents and how they function. Specifically, it
                  sheds light into the interaction of Desire, Self‐efficacy, and
                  Perceived Control in the regulation of Intention and,
                  subsequently, Behavior. Data from a two‐wave, online survey (N
                  = 403) on healthy eating tests the proposed relationships.
                  Findings reveal that Self‐efficacy and Perceived Control are
                  distinct variables and should be included in models as such.
                  More importantly, they interact to moderate the
                  Desire‐Intention relationship. When Self‐efficacy is low,
                  Perceived Control shapes the Desire‐Intention relationship.
                  When Self‐efficacy is high, the impact of Perceived Control is
                  limited. Perceived Control has a different impact than does
                  Self‐efficacy: when Perceived Control increases, so does the
                  effect of Self‐efficacy and vice versa. The results refine the
                  explanatory mechanisms underlying intention formation while
                  contributing to the fine‐tuning and improvement of the Model
                  of the Goal Directed Behavior. We reveal that the mechanisms
                  behind intention formation are more complex than originally

  abstract     = {Several theories suggest that people differ significantly in
                  their environmental sensitivity, defined as the capacity to
                  perceive and process information about the environment. More
                  sensitive people, who make up between 25\% and 30\% of the
                  population, are not only more negatively affected by adverse
                  experiences but also benefit disproportionately from positive
                  ones, in line with differential susceptibility theory.
                  Heightened emotional reactivity has been identified as one of
                  the key markers of sensitivity. However, the current
                  understanding of the relationship between sensitivity and the
                  experience and processing of emotions remains limited. In the
                  current paper we propose a new conceptual framework for the
                  multiple ways in which environmental sensitivity may impact on
                  different aspects of the experience and processing of
                  emotions. This includes heightened perception of emotions,
                  increased emotional reactivity, as well as the important role
                  of emotion regulation for the well-being of highly sensitive
                  people. In addition, we also consider rearing experiences in
                  shaping sensitivity and emotion regulation. The reviewed
                  empirical studies largely support the conceptual model but
                  more research is needed to explore the dynamics between
                  sensitivity and emotions further. Finally, we discuss several
                  implications for well-being before making a case for the
                  inclusion of individual differences in environmental
                  sensitivity in affective science. This article is part of the

                  to sensory stimulation, responses of emotional pleasure or
                  displeasure. These emotions vary from one person and culture
                  to another, yet they share a common mechanism. To survive, an
                  adaptive animal (as opposed to a tropic animal) needs to
                  become comfortable with normality and to have slight
                  abnormalities draw attention to themselves. Walking through a
                  jungle you need to notice a tiger from a single stripe: if you
                  must wait to see the whole animal, you are unlikely to
                  survive. In Homo sapiens , the brain's adaptive neurochemistry
                  does this naturally, partly because the brain's neuronal
                  networks are structured to react efficiently to fractal
                  structures, structures that shape much of nature. In addition,
                  previous associations may turn a slight variation from normal
                  into feelings of either pleasure or danger. The details of
                  these responses—what is normal and what variations feel
                  like—will depend upon an individual's experience, but the
                  mechanism is the same, no matter whether a person is tasting a
                  wine, seeing a face or landscape, or hearing a song. This

                  (exploratory sample: N = 557, N = 2,924 dyads; preregistered
                  direct replication sample: N = 306, N = 1,683 dyads). In all

                  perceiver liking when targets were higher in self-esteem, yet
                  accuracy was negatively related to perceiver liking when
                  targets were lower in self-esteem, regardless of context. In
                  sum, being seen accurately may have negative social

                  measures of health are well documented; however, the processes

                  cardiovascular and neuroendocrine responses to stress, remains
                  under explored. In the present study, we aim to address this
                  gap by examining if belonging to a social group affects
                  cardiovascular (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and
                  heart rate) and cortisol reactivity to stress. Using secondary
                  data from the Pittsburgh Cold Study, 213 healthy adults (123
                  men, 90 women; Mage = 30.13, SD = 10.85) underwent a
                  standardized laboratory stress‐testing session. During the
                  2.25 h session, participants completed psychometric measures
                  including the Social Network Index (Cohen, 1997), while
                  biological measurements were assessed noninvasively using the
                  Critikon Dynamap Monitor. Results showed that participants who
                  belonged to a social group demonstrated enhanced patterns of
                  cardiovascular adaptation to stress (i.e., peak responding at
                  initial stress exposure, then gradual decline). This suggests
                  that those who belong to a group have greater physiological
                  stress tolerance, thus indicating the benefits of group
                  membership for biomarkers of health in the long term.},

                  central that conservatives’ support for policies is increased
                  simply by framing them as a return to the past. Until now, the
                  underlying process of this temporal framing effect is unclear.
                  Drawing on theories of conservatism as motivated social
                  cognition, four preregistered studies (Ntotal = 2,405) test
                  the hypothesis that it results from conservatives’ epistemic
                  and existential beliefs about the past. Studies 1 and 2
                  demonstrate that American conservatives’ preference for
                  past-focused political communication is blocked if the past is
                  perceived to be inconsistent with these beliefs. Studies 3 and

                  theoretical models and measurement approaches. Authenticity is
                  relevant to psychological functioning, and we describe its
                  associations with self-regulation, behaviour regulation,
                  interpersonal relations, psychological health and consumer
                  behaviour. Although authenticity has beneficial effects in
                  these domains, it also has drawbacks such as the potential for
                  hypocrisy, off-putting positive self-presentation and conflict
                  in the workplace. We conclude by pinpointing empirical lacunae
                  and proposing future research directions. Authenticity is
                  promoted by cultural norms, institutions and folk wisdom, but
                  there is disagreement about what exactly authenticity is. In
                  this Review, Sedikides and Schlegel describe major
                  conceptualizations of the subjective experience of
                  authenticity and discuss its relevance for psychological
                  functioning.},

  abstract     = {Purpose This paper aims to critically evaluate the definition
                  of the brand concept, support the critique with an empirical
                  study and provide a definition to resolve the problems that
                  have been identified. Design/methodology/approach This paper
                  combines a conceptual critique with empirical research using a
                  sample of 730 journal papers to analyse the scope and number
                  of brand-related concepts in extant literature. Findings The
                  brand concept has evolved to become problematic with no
                  clarity of definition. There has been an explosion in the
                  number of brand-related concepts that make the brand concept
                  opaque and unwieldy. Based upon the findings, the authors
                  argue that it is necessary to return to a “label and
                  associations model” of the brand concept to ameliorate these
                  issues. Research limitations/implications The empirical
                  research presented examines only 730 papers from a much wider
                  body of brand literature. Nonetheless, it illustrates the fact
                  that researchers and theorists are not talking about the same
                  concept when using the term “brand”. Practical implications
                  Practitioners are not being served by academic branding
                  literature because no two researchers appear to be studying
                  the same entity. This prevents a body of research from being
                  built to guide practitioners. Originality/value This paper
                  makes an original contribution by combining a conceptual
                  critique and empirical study to examine the problems arising
                  from the absence of an agreed definition of the brand concept
                  and uses this as a foundation for creating a resolution to the
                  problems.},

                  conspicuous consumption and impulse
                  buying.Design/methodology/approachA total of 307 college
                  students in western Singapore were recruited. Confirmatory
                  factor analysis and structural equation modeling were
                  conducted to assess the psychometric properties of the scales
                  and estimate model path coefficients. A multi-group analysis
                  was conducted to test if the path coefficients in the research
                  model varied across genders.FindingsThis study found that
                  nostalgia had a positive influence on consumers’ conspicuous
                  consumption, which in turn had a positive impact on their
                  impulse buying of sport products. The results of the
                  multi-group analysis also revealed significant differences
                  across gender groups in that the impacts of nostalgia on
                  conspicuous consumption and impulse buying were stronger for
                  male consumers.Originality/valueThis study forges new ground
                  by investigating the intricate dynamics among nostalgia,
                  conspicuous consumption, and impulse buying in the context of
                  sport. By delving into the relationships between them and
                  exploring gender disparities in their effects, this study
                  enhances our understanding of the pivotal role nostalgia plays
                  in shaping consumer behavior in sport. In addition, the
                  identification of gender-specific patterns underscores the
                  significance of tailored marketing approaches for effectively
                  engaging both male and female consumers. Overall, this study
                  presents fresh perspectives that can inform the development of
                  targeted marketing strategies for sport marketers and
                  retailers aiming to optimize their offerings and promotional
                  endeavors.},

                  experiments and one archival study, the current research shows
                  that while consumers have a general preference for natural

                  the goal is to treat psychological rather than physical

                  that explains the amplified natural preference for treating
                  psychological conditions: Consumers are more concerned about
                  their true selves being altered when treating psychological
                  conditions, and they perceive natural drugs to be less likely
                  than synthetic drugs to affect their true selves. The current

                  Consumers chat with friends, search for information, and
                  complain to customer service. Salespeople pitch products,
                  employees answer questions, and market researchers ask them.
                  But communication does not occur in a vacuum. Modalities
                  (e.g., speaking or writing), channels (e.g., text, phone call,
                  or email), and devices (e.g., smartphone or computer) are the
                  mediums through which communicators communicate. While these
                  mediums often seem incidental, might they impact what gets
                  communicated? And if so, how? This paper offers a
                  comprehensive framework for understanding how mediums shape
                  the message. Specifically, we argue that modality, devices,
                  and channels all shape communication through the same two key
                  drivers: deliberation and audience salience. As a result, the
                  mediums communicators use to communicate impact everything
                  from the thoughtfulness and concreteness of communicated
                  content to the degree to which it is self‐enhancing or honest.
                  This work sheds light on the psychology of content production,
                  provides insight into the drivers and consequences of
                  communication, and highlights how emerging technologies may

                  a hallmark of human cognition. Consequently, past research has
                  investigated how we learn from others’ testimony. Yet a
                  distinct form of social information— aggregated
                  opinion—increasingly guides our judgments and decisions. We
                  investigated how people learn from such information by
                  conducting three experiments with participants recruited
                  online within the United States ( N = 886) comparing the
                  predictions of three computational models: a Bayesian solution
                  to this problem that can be implemented by a simple strategy

  abstract     = {Influential theories in psychology, neuroscience, and
                  economics assume that the exertion of mental effort should
                  feel aversive. Yet, this assumption is usually untested, and
                  it is challenged by casual observations and previous studies.
                  Here, we meta-analyze (a) whether mental effort is generally
                  experienced as aversive and (b) whether the association
                  between mental effort and aversive feelings depends on
                  population and task characteristics. We meta-analyzed a set of
                  170 studies (from 125 articles published in 2019–2020; 358
                  different tasks; 4,670 unique subjects). These studies were
                  conducted in a variety of populations (e.g., health care
                  employees, military employees, amateur athletes, college
                  students; data were collected in 29 different countries) and
                  used a variety of tasks (e.g., equipment testing tasks,
                  virtual reality tasks, cognitive performance tasks). Despite
                  this diversity, these studies had one crucial common feature:
                  All used the NASA Task Load Index to examine participants’
                  experiences of effort and negative affect. As expected, we
                  found a strong positive association between mental effort and
                  negative affect. Surprisingly, just one of our 15 moderators
                  had a significant effect (effort felt somewhat less aversive
                  in studies from Asia vs. Europe and North America). Overall,
                  mental effort felt aversive in different types of tasks (e.g.,
                  tasks with and without feedback), in different types of
                  populations (e.g., university-educated populations and
                  non-university-educated populations), and on different
                  continents. Supporting theories that conceptualize effort as a
                  cost, we suggest that mental effort is inherently aversive.

                  aimed at promoting recovery: one based on mindfulness and one
                  involving applying cognitive–behavioral strategies. Both
                  interventions were embedded in a measurement burst design,
                  which allowed us to examine the mechanisms underlying change
                  or intervention success. To explore mechanisms of change, we
                  used the stressor-detachment model as a theoretical framework.
                  We operationalized the interventions’ effects in three ways:
                  as changes from pretest to posttest, as changes in daily
                  states, and as changes in daily associations. To this end, we
                  used intensive longitudinal data to examine the roles that
                  daily negative activation plays in detachment and strain. In a
                  randomized controlled trial (N = 393), we administered three
                  assessments of traits: pretest, posttest (8 weeks later), and
                  follow-up (3 months after the posttest). We also administered
                  2 work weeks of experience sampling questionnaires
                  (preintervention and postintervention). Latent change models
                  and Bayes factor equivalence tests revealed that both
                  interventions substantially—and to a similar extent—increased
                  detachment. Bayesian multilevel path models showed
                  improvements in all state variables, including improvements in
                  negative activation, and provided some evidence that
                  mindfulness-based and cognitive–behavioral approaches might
                  tackle different processes at the daily level. We discuss
                  theoretical implications for the literature on recovery from
                  work and specifically for the stressor-detachment model.

                in the world. Successfully predicting the winners presents a
                challenge, demanding a profound comprehension of the music
                industry and its evolving trends. In this study, we present an
                experimental Predictive Analytics tool that utilizes AI
                algorithms and harnesses alternative data sources to predict the
                winners in the categories of Song of the Year, Record of the
                Year, and Rap Song of the Year. Our method (1) collects, mines,
                and fuses data from various alternative sources, such as
                Billboard rankings, music features of the song, Google search
                volume, and lyrics, among other sources, and (2) trains AI
                algorithms to learn from historical data. Our empirical results
                indicate that the AI tool can accurately predict the winners of
                these three categories for the last three years. For Song of the
                Year, our algorithm indicates that energy, acousticness, and
                loudness were among the best predictive features for a
                Grammy-winning song. For Record of the Year, profanity and
                sadness were identified as some of the most predictive features.
                Meanwhile, for Rap song of the Year, negative sentiment, the
                number of words, and happiness score emerged as the key features
                for a Grammy-winning song. The framework presented here has the
                potential to be utilized by artists for a data-driven approach
                to songwriting and music production, enabling record labels and
                music fans to gain insights into the factors influencing the
                odds of winning an award.},

                  risk‐taking in the form of unethical behavior can lead to
                  successful entry and that this entry can drive incumbents to
                  either adopt similar behavior or potentially be forced out of
                  the market. Thus, entrepreneurs can introduce innovative, but
                  socially destructive, behavior to a market and motivate its
                  adoption by incumbents. Empirical support is found using a
                  policy change in the liver transplant market to identify the
                  use and adoption of unethical misrepresentation of patient
                  health status. This article contributes to our understanding
                  of entrepreneurial strategy as well as the competitive
                  dynamics between entrants and incumbents in adopting new risky
                  innovations and, in particular, unethical behaviors.Managerial
                  SummaryThis article highlights the impact of strategic
                  risk‐taking through unethical practices, showing how they can
                  sometimes lead to a successful market entry. Successful entry
                  can force existing market players to either follow suit or
                  risk being forced out of the market. This study looks at the
                  liver transplant market, where transplant centers took
                  advantage of a previous policy by misrepresenting patient
                  health status to move their patients to the top of the
                  transplant list. The findings underscore the importance of
                  understanding the competitive dynamics of adopting innovative
                  yet ethically questionable strategies by both new entrants and
                  established companies, offering valuable insights into how
                  businesses navigate competitive pressures and ethical
                  boundaries. It also highlights the importance of policymakers
                  considering these competitive dynamics when setting policy.},

                  to test whether interpersonal trust depends on perceived
                  self–other overlap. As previous studies suggest that enfacing
                  (feeling ownership for, and include more into oneself of the
                  face of) an avatar might make one trust this avatar more, we
                  exposed participants to faces of ingroup and outgroup avatars
                  that moved in synchrony or out of synchrony with the
                  participant’s own facial movements, and assessed the impact of
                  synchrony on self–other overlap and trust measures. Experiment
                  1 used ingroup faces and successfully showed that synchrony
                  (manipulated within-participants) increased self–other overlap
                  and trust, which we assessed by means of the Trust Game and
                  the Implicit Association Test (IAT). In Experiment 2, which
                  used outgroup faces and a within-participants design,
                  synchrony still increased scores in the Trust Game but the IAT
                  was no longer affected. Experiment 3 replicated Experiment 2
                  but with synchrony varying between participants, which
                  eliminated the synchrony effect in both trust measures.
                  Importantly, Inclusion of Other in the Self (IOS) ratings were
                  found to predict the IAT effect in synchronous conditions.
                  Taken altogether, our findings suggest that interpersonal
                  trust is mainly driven by perceived self–other overlap.
                  Besides group identification, appearance, and voluntary
                  movement, synchrony is just one of several sources
                  contributing to perceived self–other overlap.},

                  influencers incur significant interpersonal and professional

                  comments. These outcomes are driven by the perception that the
                  influencer is less receptive to consumer voice (e.g.,
                  consumers’ thoughts, opinions, and suggestions) and, thus,

                  challenges to the use of evolutionary psychology in tourism.
                  These challenges are: (1) a difficulty in distinguishing
                  proximate from ultimate explanations, (2) a belief that
                  evolutionary psychology focuses on nature, and ignores
                  nurture, (3) a belief in human exceptionalism, (4) an
                  impression that evolutionary psychology overemphasizes gender
                  differences, (5) a view of evolutionary psychology as a
                  single, unified theory, and (6) a belief that evolutionary
                  psychology can be used to justify genetic determinism, sexism,
                  and racism. In identifying and responding to these challenges,
                  we hope to inspire scholars to consider adopting an

                  intent and the capacity to cooperate with beings that are
                  living and dead, human and otherwise. I discuss the

                  effects on human cognition, affect, motivation, and behavior.
                  Integrating across three major theoretical papers and dozens
                  of empirical papers, I argue that the psychological structure
                  and function of collective consciousness are intertwined; the

  abstract     = {Changing how we feel can be adaptive, but it is also difficult
                  and may require effort. There is research on what people want
                  to achieve in emotion regulation (motivational content), but
                  there is little research on how intensely people pursue what
                  they want to achieve (motivational intensity). We tested the
                  role of motivational intensity in emotion regulation, by
                  assessing (Studies 1–2, Ns = 160 and 157) and manipulating
                  (Study 3, N = 250) it in daily life. As predicted, when people
                  were more motivated to make themselves feel better, they
                  engaged more intensely in emotion-regulatory behaviors,
                  experienced more desirable emotional experiences, and reported
                  better psychological health. Furthermore, motivating people to
                  make themselves feel better, increased their
                  emotion-regulatory behaviors and led to better psychological
                  health during COVID-19. Motivational intensity, therefore, may
                  be an understudied factor facilitating emotional well-being.},

                  intelligence (CQ), and an expanded criterion domain of job
                  performance. Positioning CQ in the nomological network of
                  personality traits is timely because research has demonstrated
                  that CQ predicts a range of work‐related outcomes in today's
                  multicultural workplace. Drawing on the Cybernetic Big Five
                  Theory (CB5T), we conduct a meta‐analytic investigation (n =
                  24,552; k = 109) of the metatraits of stability (shared
                  variance of conscientiousness, agreeableness, and emotional
                  stability) and plasticity (shared variance of extraversion and
                  openness) on CQ and five job performance outcomes (task
                  performance, affiliative citizenship performance,
                  change‐oriented citizenship performance, adaptive performance,
                  and creative performance). Our findings show that CQ is a
                  stronger mediator of the plasticity metatrait (than stability)

                  discover intriguing suppressor effects, suggesting that the

                  could be underestimated in existing Big Five meta‐analyses.},

                  and consumption to success and happiness, negatively affects
                  interpersonal relationships. Prior work has typically
                  explained these effects through the allocation of personal
                  resources (such as time or money) within relationships, thus
                  using a behavioural route. However, this research proposes an
                  alternative cognitive pathway to understand the adverse
                  effects of materialism on interpersonal relationships. Three
                  studies (N = 1389) employing correlational and experimental
                  methodologies showed that materialism leads to heightened
                  expectations and standards for a significant other, which are
                  associated with poorer interpersonal outcomes. Specifically,
                  materialism heightens the ideal standards that one has for a
                  close other around achievement (e.g., ambition) and positive
                  image (e.g., attractiveness), which are linked to higher
                  conflict and lower relational satisfaction. Therefore, this
                  work contributes to deepening our understanding of how
                  consumer‐oriented values shape social perceptions and
                  negatively affect interpersonal dynamics. Practical
                  applications include informing relationship counselling
                  practices, developing educational interventions, and guiding
                  marketers and media content producers towards messages that do
                  not increase individuals' ideals and standards for themselves
                  and others. Further research should explore other factors that
                  might alter this mediation (e.g., mindfulness) and examine the
                  short‐ and long‐term effects through longitudinal and

                  creativity via two primary mechanisms—exploration and
                  absorption. We propose that vitality is a more fundamental
                  mechanism integrating them. According to the
                  self‐determination theory, curiosity fuels vitality as it
                  aligns with the natural inclination toward autonomy,
                  competence, and relatedness. It is through enhanced vitality
                  that curiosity further leads to exploration and absorption,
                  which altogether lead to higher creativity. Considering that
                  curiosity varies daily, we adopted a daily diary design over
                  10 consecutive workdays and tested the proposed effects at the
                  within‐person level. The results confirmed that daily
                  curiosity promotes creativity through elevated daily vitality
                  and daily exploration and absorption. More importantly, when
                  accounting for the effect of daily vitality, the mediating
                  effect of exploration and absorption was no longer

                  fundamental mechanism responsible for the positive effect of
                  curiosity on creativity, providing a refined understanding of

                  taking, and how do they depend on the domain or situation in
                  which the decision is being made? Psychologists currently
                  answer such questions with psychometric methods, which analyze
                  correlations across participant responses in survey data sets.
                  In this article, we analyze the preferences that give rise to
                  these correlations. Our approach uses (a) large language
                  models (LLMs) to quantify everyday risky behaviors in terms of
                  the attributes or reasons that may describe those behaviors,
                  and (b) decision models to map these attributes and reasons
                  onto participant responses. We show that LLM-based decision
                  models can explain observed correlations between behaviors in
                  terms of the reasons different behaviors elicit and explain
                  observed correlations between individuals in terms of the
                  weights different individuals place on reasons, thereby
                  providing a decision theoretic foundation for psychometric
                  findings. Since LLMs can generate quantitative representations
                  for nearly any naturalistic decision, they can be used to make
                  accurate out-of-sample predictions for hundreds of everyday
                  behaviors, predict the reasons why people may or may not want
                  to engage in these behaviors, and interpret these reasons in
                  terms of core psychological constructs. Our approach has
                  important theoretical and practical implications for the study
                  of heterogeneity in everyday behavior. (PsycInfo Database

  abstract     = {Many social ties end when one side rejects the other, but
                  rejection does not need to happen directly. Ghosting—the act
                  of ending a relationship by ignoring another person’s attempts
                  to connect—is a common way of ending social ties. The present
                  experiments first establish the key characteristics of
                  ghosting and distinguish it from other rejection behaviors
                  (Pilot Studies 1a–1c). The experiments then proceed to explore
                  the relational and motivational implications of this behavior,
                  finding that ghosters (those who ghost) care about the
                  well-being of ghostees (those who are ghosted) more than
                  ghostees realize. This result occurs in recalled instances of
                  ghosting (Experiment 1), when ghosting in real time
                  (Experiment 2), and when refraining from ghosting is
                  monetarily costly (Experiment 3). We find that this occurs
                  partly because ghostees underestimate the other-oriented
                  motives involved in ghosting, misunderstanding that ghosters
                  ghost partly as a way to end a tie while avoiding hurting
                  ghostees’ feelings (Experiments 4–6). Indeed, greater
                  other-oriented motives lead to a higher likelihood of ghosting
                  others (Experiment 7). A final experiment finds relational
                  consequences whereby ghostees miss out on opportunities for
                  future help exchange due to their underestimation of the
                  extent to which ghosters care about them (Experiment 8).
                  Ghosting is social rejection without explanation or feedback,
                  but not without care. This study highlights how prosocial
                  motives can drive rejection behaviors and the role of
                  interpersonal accuracy in mitigating the negative effects of
                  social rejection. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all

                  processes that explain how message repetition shapes
                  persuasion over time, yet these processes are often studied in
                  isolation. Moreover, repeated exposure theories have largely
                  failed to specify the temporal trajectories of negative
                  message responses over time. Integrating theorizing on
                  repeated exposure, psychological reactance, and message
                  fatigue, we conducted a mixed-design experiment (N = 1,416
                  total observations), varying the amount of daily exposure
                  audiences had to campaign advertisements about distracted
                  driving over nearly 2 weeks. Exposure to these messages
                  (compared to control messages) led to greater message
                  elaboration and reactance but not fatigue or attitudes. We
                  found no evidence that these message reactions shifted
                  linearly, logarithmically, or quadratically over time, with
                  the exception that anger increased linearly with subsequent
                  exposures. These findings suggest constraints on predictions
                  made by repeated exposure frameworks, and post hoc analyses
                  underscore the need to distinguish fatigue’s two dimensions

                  alleviates the interpersonal competence deficits that
                  accompany social anxiety. We tested and supported this
                  hypothesis in six studies ( N = 1,858), three preregistered.

                  social anxiety individuals more frequently identified
                  interpersonal incompetence as a trigger of nostalgia. In

                  negatively with interpersonal competence, but positively with
                  nostalgia, which in turn predicted higher interpersonal
                  competence. In the final four studies, we tested causation.
                  Although social anxiety reduced interpersonal competence, it
                  also triggered nostalgia (Studies 3–3S), and nostalgia
                  increased interpersonal competence (Studies 4–5).},

  abstract     = {AbstractLife in society revolves around social norms. These
                  norms play a crucial role in regulating and influencing
                  individuals’ behavior, both at the societal and individual
                  levels. They offer a psychological framework that reduces
                  uncertainty, guides behavior, and aids people in adapting to
                  their social surroundings. Moreover, by observing prevailing
                  social norms, individuals gain insights into societal trends
                  that preserve cherished values and traditions across
                  generations, thus mapping the dynamics of social stability and
                  change. Social change is closely tied to shifts in these
                  norms, which can occur at varying speeds, influenced by
                  factors at multiple levels of analysis, including societal,
                  group, and individual levels. In this article, I analyze the
                  various concepts of social norms found in the literature, with
                  a particular focus on their role in psychology. I describe the
                  main sources of normative influence and illustrate, with
                  multiple examples, how they operate in different social
                  contexts. In this way, I address how these norms guide and
                  facilitate participation in collective actions, their
                  intergenerational transmission, and their role in the
                  emergence of radicalization in social protest contexts.
                  Furthermore, I delve into how group norms are linked to
                  intergroup contact experiences involving both advantaged and
                  disadvantaged group members, as well as the expression of
                  prejudice and affective polarization. I conclude by
                  emphasizing the necessity of adopting a multilevel approach to
                  comprehend the connection between norms and social change.},

                  organizations, markets and societies. Through distributed
                  cognition and coordination, collectives can achieve outcomes
                  that exceed the capabilities of individuals—even
                  experts—resulting in improved accuracy and novel capabilities.
                  Often, collective intelligence is supported by information
                  technology, such as online prediction markets that elicit the
                  ‘wisdom of crowds’, online forums that structure collective
                  deliberation or digital platforms that crowdsource knowledge
                  from the public. Large language models, however, are
                  transforming how information is aggregated, accessed and
                  transmitted online. Here we focus on the unique opportunities
                  and challenges this transformation poses for collective
                  intelligence. We bring together interdisciplinary perspectives
                  from industry and academia to identify potential benefits,
                  risks, policy-relevant considerations and open research
                  questions, culminating in a call for a closer examination of
                  how large language models affect humans’ ability to
                  collectively tackle complex problems. Collective intelligence
                  is the basis for group success and is frequently supported by
                  information technology. Burton et al. argue that large
                  language models are transforming information access and
                  transmission, presenting both opportunities and challenges for
                  collective intelligence.},

                  build models of the world and use them for intelligent
                  decision-making. Here we challenge the dominant assumption
                  that humans form only forward predictions, which specify what
                  future events are likely to follow a given present event. We
                  demonstrate that in some environments, it is more efficient to
                  use backward prediction, which specifies what present events
                  are likely to precede a given future event. This is
                  particularly the case in diverging environments, where
                  possible future events outnumber possible present events.
                  Correspondingly, in six preregistered experiments (n = 1,299)
                  involving both simple decision-making and more challenging
                  planning tasks, we find that humans engage in backward
                  prediction in divergent environments and use forward
                  prediction in convergent environments. We thus establish that
                  humans adaptively deploy forward and backward prediction in
                  the service of efficient decision-making. Models of
                  decision-making assume we predict forward from an action to
                  its potential outcomes. In six studies, Sharp and Eldar show
                  that humans also predict backward from a desired outcome to
                  its preceding actions, particularly in divergent environments.},

                  particularly beneficial for those who are already sufficiently
                  active. Two groups of sufficiently and insufficiently active
                  participants were recruited to complete a 20-min
                  moderate-intensity exercise (based on 55\%–65\% of heart rate
                  reserve) on treadmill in three different experimental
                  conditions (mindfulness, attention distraction, and
                  no-intervention control) in a randomized order. Core affective
                  valence was measured repeatedly during exercise. Linear
                  mixed-effects modeling and subsequent Tukey post hoc
                  comparisons revealed that more positive affective responses
                  occurred in the mindfulness condition than in attention
                  distraction and control conditions, but only among those who
                  reported sufficient physical activity in their daily lives. We
                  also found that participants in the insufficiently active
                  group experienced more pleasant feelings in the attention
                  distraction condition than in the control condition.
                  Additional exploratory analysis suggested that all
                  participants reported a more positive forecasted affect for
                  exercising in the future in mindfulness and attention
                  distraction conditions, whereas only the sufficiently active
                  group reported greater postexercise enjoyment after
                  mindfulness condition. We interpret these findings as evidence
                  that nonregular exercisers should be advised to divert their
                  attention from their bodily sensations during
                  moderate-intensity physical activity rather than to be
                  mindful, which is more appropriate for those who are already
                  used to regular exercise. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024

                  bases, our review of the selected articles illustrates the
                  dynamic entanglement of these ostensibly distinct and
                  polarised strategic and epistemic bases of risk studies. We
                  then develop a conceptual framework to map the field of risk
                  research and propose avenues for future research. Our
                  framework enables us to propose a stronger focus on risk
                  taking for opportunity, warn against becoming overly focused
                  on the metrics for controlling harm especially in the face of
                  enticing visualizations of harmful risk, and strongly assert
                  values as an important epistemic basis for risk studies. As
                  these values may be hidden or visible, we emphasize the
                  importance of understanding whose values are foregrounded in
                  proposing a research agenda for reclaiming societal benefit.
                  This latter focus is a neglected area of risk studies yet
                  vitally important in addressing the big societal issues of our
                  time.},

                  a negative impact of cognitive load on financial risk.

                  individuals are required to evaluate stereotyped groups both
                  low‐prejudice and high‐prejudice persons will automatically
                  activate the pertinent stereotype content. Controlled
                  inhibition of the content of the stereotype characterizes
                  low‐prejudice responses and distinguishes low‐from
                  high‐prejudice persons. The experimental evidence Devine
                  (1989) reports to support this model is criticized on several
                  grounds, and a methodology that avoids these shortcomings is
                  described. Two groups of subjects were tested, one with and
                  one without a stereotype of the target group. The results from
                  the group knowledgeable of the stereotype were inconsistent
                  with Devine's (1989) model. Differences in the automatic
                  activation of stereotype content, rather than differences in
                  the tendency to employ strategies to inhibit stereotype
                  content, were related to levels of prejudice towards the
                  target group. The results from a sample of subjects not
                  possessing a stereotype of the target group confirmed the
                  integral role of automatic processes in prejudice. Prejudice
                  for these subjects was related to the tendency to
                  automatically activate negative rather than positive concepts,
                  irrespective of their relatedness to the stereotype of the
                  target group. The implications of these findings for Devine's
                  (1989) model and the more general nature of the relationship
                  between stereotypes and prejudice are discussed, and the

                  games are presented, and the interrelated concepts are
                  analyzed around the more or less central problem of utility.
                  The book is divided into 12 chapters, the first being a
                  formulation of the economic problem, presenting the objectives
                  of the system used, the notion of utility, and a description
                  of the structure of the authors' theory. The second chapter is
                  a general formal description of games of strategy, and
                  chapters 3-8 treat particular classifications of games. In
                  chapter 9, the authors discuss the composition and
                  decomposition of games. Chapter 10 is on simple games, and
                  chapter 11 on general non-zero-sum games. (These are games in
                  which the sum of all payments received by all players is not
                  zero. Thus such games involve production or destruction of
                  goods and are more closely analogous to general social and
                  economic situations than zero-sum games.) The concluding
                  chapter presents a generalization of the concept of utility
                  and the discussion of an example. (PsycINFO Database Record

               poor psychological adjustment and functioning and high

                  perform interim analyses while data collection is ongoing,
                  could offer a remedy. However, they are scarcely used in
                  consumer behavior research, probably owing to low awareness,
                  perceived complexity, or concerns about the validity of this
                  approach. This article offers a tutorial on group sequential
                  designs and introduces Pre-Registered Interim Analysis Designs
                  (PRIADs): A practical five-step procedure to facilitate the
                  adoption of these designs in marketing. We show that group
                  sequential designs can be easily adopted by marketing
                  researchers, and introduce a companion app to help researchers
                  implement them. We demonstrate multiple benefits of PRIADs for
                  researchers engaged in confirmatory hypothesis testing: They
                  facilitate sample size decisions, allow researchers to achieve
                  a desired level of statistical power with a smaller number of
                  observations, and help conduct more efficient pilot studies.
                  We validate this cost-saving potential through a comprehensive
                  re-analysis of 212 studies published in the Journal of
                  Consumer Research, which shows that using PRIADs would have
                  reduced participant costs by 20–29\%. We conclude with a

               variability in the development of self-concept clarity and the
               mechanisms and outcomes of this variability. Specifically, we
               consider the current literature regarding the way in which
               family, identity development, and adult social roles facilitate
               the development of self-concept clarity. Further, we examine
               findings that suggest self-concept clarity promotes personality
               trait maturation and psychological well-being. We close with
               specific future directions for research in self-concept clarity
               development across the lifespan.},

                  factors that improve or hinder employee creativity, a better

                  motivates consumers to forego pleasure seeking, typically by
                  selecting virtue over vice. We propose that in the absence of
                  virtuous options, consumers with a self-regulatory goal will
                  instead choose less variety in choice sets of exclusively vice
                  options because the extra pleasure that variety affords seems
                  incompatible with the goal. We find converging evidence for
                  the decrease in variety seeking in vice categories across five
                  studies (and three supplementary studies in the web appendix,
                  N = 6,066), using both scenario-based and actual consumption
                  contexts. We also demonstrate the underlying process:
                  consumers are motivated to curtail pleasure seeking when
                  pursuing a weight-loss goal and that leads them to choose less
                  variety in vice categories when there is no virtue alternative

                  develops during childhood and has identified peaks, slumps,
                  and bumps during maturation. However, little is known about
                  the causes of such changes. This study employed a longitudinal
                  approach to assess predictors of change in creative ideation
                  over 2 years in young people (N = 76) aged 14–20 years old at
                  the first time point. The analysis employed frequentist and
                  Bayesian methods to evaluate the effect of individual factors,
                  such as openness to experience (assessed using the BFI‐10
                  short form), and contextual factors, such as pursuing creative
                  hobbies (measured with a leisure questionnaire). Openness at
                  the first time point and change in openness over time
                  predicted change in peak originality. Engagement in creative
                  hobbies at the first time point predicted change in fluency.
                  The findings support the contribution of individual factors,
                  in the form of openness to experience, and contextual factors,
                  in the form of engagement in creative hobbies, in the
                  development of divergent thinking abilities in mid‐adolescence
                  and young adulthood. Altogether, this study suggests that
                  interventions aimed at increasing time spent on creative
                  activities and promoting openness to experience may enhance
                  divergent thinking abilities, which are essential components
                  of creative potential.},

                  to infer OCEAN traits from text.BackgroundThe psycholexical
                  approach allows retrieving information about personality
                  traits from human language. However, it has rarely been
                  applied because of methodological and practical issues that
                  current computational advancements could
                  overcome.MethodClassical taxonomies and a large Yelp corpus
                  were leveraged to learn an embedding for each personality
                  trait. These embeddings were used to train a feedforward
                  neural network for predicting trait values. Their
                  generalization performances have been evaluated through two
                  external validation studies involving experts (N = 11) and
                  laypeople (N = 100) in a discrimination task about the best
                  markers of each trait and polarity.ResultsIntrinsic validation
                  of the model yielded excellent results, with R2 values greater
                  than 0.78. The validation studies showed a high proportion of
                  matches between participants' choices and model predictions,
                  confirming its efficacy in identifying new terms related to
                  the OCEAN traits. The best performance was observed for
                  agreeableness and extraversion, especially for their positive
                  polarities. The model was less efficient in identifying the
                  negative polarity of openness and
                  conscientiousness.ConclusionsThis innovative methodology can
                  be considered a “psycholexical approach 2.0,” contributing to
                  research in personality and its practical applications in many

  abstract     = {Purpose Heritage tourism is an increasingly popular form of
                  tourism that allows individuals to connect with the past and
                  immerse themselves in cultural and historical narratives.
                  Hence, the purpose of this study is to explore the intricate
                  relationships among vicarious nostalgia (VNOS), memorable
                  tourism experiences (MTEXs) and their collective influence on
                  tourists’ behavioral intentions (BINTs). Additionally, this
                  study examines the moderating effect of social return (SN) in
                  the context of heritage tourism. Design/methodology/approach
                  Data were gathered using a self-administered questionnaire
                  from 259 tourists visiting heritage sites in Jaipur. The
                  proposed model was tested using structural equation modeling.
                  Findings The results confirmed that VNOS had a significant
                  positive impact on BINT in the context of heritage tourism.
                  The causal relationship between VNOS and BINT was fully
                  mediated by MTEX. The results further verified that the
                  presence of SN strengthens the association between MTEXs and
                  BINT. Practical implications This research will guide the
                  firms associated with heritage tourism to target specific
                  cohorts interested in heritage tourism. Policymakers may find
                  it easier to create unique offerings and packages that appeal
                  to visitors interested in historical sites and produce
                  memorable travel experiences. One key implication is to create
                  “social media friendly spaces” at different locations of the
                  sites. To increase tourism, managers may use the findings from
                  this research to create plans for the ethical promotion and
                  protection of cultural and natural heritage sites.
                  Originality/value Overall, this research advances the
                  understanding of the role of VNOS in heritage tourism by
                  elucidating its cognitive and emotional aspects and their
                  subsequent influence on the memorability of tourist
                  experiences and BINT s. Additionally, by considering the
                  moderating effect of SN, this study provides a comprehensive
                  view of how these factors collectively shape tourists’
                  decisions and actions in the context of heritage destinations.
                  This research has been conducted in the heritage city of
                  Jaipur (North-Western India), which, surprisingly – despite
                  its popularity as a heritage tourism site – has not been

                  harmful or wasteful, such as mutilation practises or extensive
                  body tattoos. We suggest such norms arise to serve as signals
                  that distinguish between ingroup ‘friends' and outgroup
                  ‘foes', facilitating parochial cooperation. Combining insights
                  from research on signalling and parochial cooperation, we
                  incorporate a trust game with signalling in an agent-based
                  model to study the dynamics of signalling norm emergence in
                  groups with conflicting interests. Our results show that
                  costly signalling norms emerge from random acts of signalling
                  in minority groups that benefit most from parochial
                  cooperation. Majority groups are less likely to develop costly
                  signalling norms. Yet, norms that prescribe sending costless
                  group identity signals can easily emerge in groups of all
                  sizes—albeit, at times, at the expense of minority group
                  members. Further, the dynamics of signalling norm emergence
                  differ across signal costs, relative group sizes, and levels
                  of ingroup assortment. Our findings provide theoretical
                  insights into norm evolution in contexts where groups develop
                  identity markers in response to environmental challenges that
                  put their interests at odds with the interests of other
                  groups. Such contexts arise in zones of ethnic conflict or
                  during contestations of existing power relations. This article

                  creativity rests on the assumption that creativity unfolds as
                  a stimulus‐driven response to affective states. We challenge
                  this assumption and examine whether personality dynamics
                  moderate the relationships between positive and negative mood
                  with creativity.Theoretical ModelAccording to our model,
                  personality dynamics that generate and maintain positive
                  affect and downregulate negative affect energize creativity.
                  Based on this model, we expect high creativity in response to
                  negative mood if people engage in self‐motivation and achieve
                  a reduction in negative mood. We further derive that
                  individual differences in action versus state orientation
                  moderate the within‐person relationship between mood and
                  creativity.MethodWe conducted an experience‐sampling study and
                  examined the relationship between mood and creativity in
                  everyday work‐life. Two hundred and ten participants indicated
                  their action‐state orientation and reported their mood three
                  times a day over five consecutive workdays. At noon of each
                  day, we assessed self‐motivation and in the evening the extent
                  to which participants had generated novel and useful ideas
                  during the day.ResultsWe observed high creativity when
                  negative mood declined and self‐motivation was high.
                  Action‐state orientation moderated the within‐person
                  relationships of positive and negative mood with
                  creativity.ConclusionPersonality dynamics determine whether
                  positive and negative mood result in creativity.},

                  report, and how? While affect is a broad term, research
                  suggests that different emotions predict distinct political
                  behaviors. Therefore, it is vital to understand what emotions
                  partisans report. However, as research on motivated reasoning
                  suggests that people process information consistent with their
                  partisan mind, I argue that they may not necessarily report
                  the emotions they feel. Instead, they may ascribe normatively
                  desirable emotions to their ingroup and normatively
                  undesirable emotions to opposing outgroups. Doing so makes
                  their ingroup distinct from and superior to outgroups. This
                  article develops and showcases this argument. I analyze data
                  in which affective polarization was likely high—interviews
                  with radical‐right voters conducted before a major election—to
                  illustrate what emotions partisans report and how. The
                  discussion invites future research to test how affective
                  polarization correlates with single emotions and whether
                  partisans strengthen polarization by how they talk about
                  emotions.},

                  research, we propose that healthy eating is not only
                  facilitated by the actual available support in society, but
                  equally well by individuals’ subjective perception on how
                  helpful the provided support truly is. We refer to the latter
                  as “perceived societal support” and examine how this
                  influences healthy eating. Across two experimental studies, we
                  observe that perceived societal support positively affects
                  healthy eating: People who perceive the available support as
                  helpful are more likely to choose healthy food over unhealthy
                  food (study 1) and consume less from an unhealthy food product
                  (study 2) compared to people who perceive the available
                  support as less helpful. These findings do not only contribute

                  circumstances that includes openness, awareness, and
                  engagement. It has roots in behavior analysis, and it is
                  linked to a philosophy of science called functional
                  contextualism and to a specific therapy approach called
                  Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. One of the earliest and
                  most developed research areas in which this model and therapy
                  have been applied is chronic pain. This review describes
                  psychological flexibility and its facets in more detail, sets
                  them in a context of relevant psychological models, and
                  examines related assessment and treatment methods. It also
                  examines evidence, current challenges, and future directions.
                  It is proposed that psychological flexibility, or an expanded

                  current research and treatment approaches in chronic pain and

                  the nature of the time constraint, an absolute versus relative
                  constraint increases risk preferences, but an ambiguous versus
                  objective constraint decreases risk preferences. In terms of
                  negative outcome salience, risk preferences decrease if the
                  risk is learned about from a description (vs. experience) or
                  the outcome is framed as a loss (vs. gain). Negative outcome
                  severity also exerts an effect, as discrete choices lower risk
                  preferences compared with attitudinal risk. In addition to
                  managerial and public policy implications based on
                  simulations, a comprehensive research agenda that builds on
                  the robust insights of this meta-analysis is offered.},

                  of the stereotype content model (SCM) in the field of
                  marketing from macro (the country of origin), meso- (corporate
                  image) and micro (service providers, brands, advertising and
                  promotions) levels.Design/methodology/approachThis paper
                  collects, reviews and summarizes the relevant literature, and
                  prospects future research directions from three levels on this
                  research topic.FindingsFirst, the authors contend that
                  competence primacy popularizes in the early work but warmth
                  becomes more influential recently. Second, they identify and
                  discuss two doubts of the SCM in marketing, namely the moral
                  dimension and the link between brands as intentional agents
                  framework (BIAF) and the brand personality theory. Finally,
                  they suggest several research avenues for the use of SCM in
                  marketing research, including research on nation branding,
                  emerging global brands and Confucianist cultures at macro
                  level, artificial intelligence and warmth-as-competence
                  strategy at meso-level, and brand personality and the brand
                  animal logo at micro level.Originality/valueAs an established
                  framework in social psychology, the SCM has been increasingly
                  applied in marketing research and a literature review in this
                  light appears timely. This paper conducts for the first time a
                  comprehensive review of the SCM in the marketing field on
                  three levels, projects promising research directions, and thus
                  contributes to the academia of marketing.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Why do many people underestimate economic and racial
                  inequality and maintain that theirs is a meritocratic society?
                  Existing work suggests that people are rationalizing,
                  misinformed, or misled. This article proposes an additional
                  explanation: Inequality itself makes economic and racial
                  disparities difficult to understand. In unequal societies,
                  individuals establish their networks at formative institutions
                  patterned by class and race. As a result, they unwittingly
                  condition on key causal pathways when making descriptive and
                  causal inferences about inequality. We use a simple
                  agent-based model to show that, under circumstances typical to
                  highly stratified societies, individuals will underestimate
                  the extent of economic and racial inequality, downplay the
                  importance of inherited advantages, and overestimate the
                  relative importance of individual ability. Moreover, we show
                  that they will both underestimate the extent of racial
                  discrimination and overestimate its relative importance.
                  Because segregated social worlds bias inference in these ways,
                  all individuals (rich and poor) have principled reasons to
                  favor less redistribution than they would if their social
                  worlds were more integrated.},

                  potentially traumatic nature of racial/ethnic discrimination,
                  diagnostic systems continue to omit these exposures from
                  trauma definitions. This study contributes to this discussion
                  by examining the co-occurrence of conventional forms of
                  potentially traumatic experiences (PTEs) with in-person and
                  online forms of racism-based potentially traumatic experiences
                  (rPTEs) like racial/ethnic discrimination. Additionally, we
                  investigated the unique association of rPTEs with
                  posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive
                  disorder (MDD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD),
                  accounting for demographics and other PTEs. Participants were
                  (N = 570) 12-to-17-year-old (Mage = 14.53; 51.93\% female)
                  ethnoracially minoritized adolescents (54.21\% Black; 45.79\%
                  Latiné). Youth completed online surveys of PTEs, in-person and
                  online rPTEs, and mental health. Bivariate analyses indicated
                  that youth who reported in-person and online rPTEs were more
                  likely to experience all conventional PTEs. Accounting for
                  demographics and conventional PTEs, in-person and online rPTEs
                  were significantly associated with PTSD (in-person: aOR =
                  2.60, 95\% CI [1.39, 4.86]; online: aOR = 2.74, 95\% CI [1.41,
                  5.34]) and GAD (in-person: aOR = 2.94, 95\% CI [1.64, 5.29];
                  online: aOR = 2.25, 95\% CI [1.24, 4.04]) and demonstrated the
                  strongest effect sizes of all trauma exposures. In-person, but
                  not online, rPTEs were linked with an increased risk for MDD
                  (aOR = 4.47, 95\% CI [1.77, 11.32]). Overall, rPTEs
                  demonstrated stronger associations with PTSD, MDD, and GAD
                  compared to conventional PTEs. Findings align with racial
                  trauma frameworks proposing that racial/ethnic discrimination
                  is a unique traumatic stressor with distinct mental health
                  impacts on ethnoracially minoritized youth. (PsycInfo Database

                  healthcare operations, mix uncertainty – the variation in the
                  complexity of care required by the patient mix, and volume
                  uncertainty – the variation in the volume of care demanded by
                  the patient population. Using an interdisciplinary
                  perspective, we study the impact of mix and volume
                  uncertainties on two important healthcare outcomes, length of
                  stay and number of procedures, along with the mitigation
                  impacts of the operational concepts of related focus and
                  utilization levels. Based on large dataset of 830,853 patient
                  discharges in 26 clinical departments across 731 hospitals in
                  five U.S. Midwest states, our results indicate that mix and
                  volume uncertainties each have a significant impact on patient
                  care. We also find that related focus and department
                  utilization levels have a mitigating effect on uncertainty in
                  healthcare settings. Lastly, we find considerable
                  heterogeneity in the effects of uncertainty across hospital
                  types and departments. We discuss key research and managerial
                  implications of our findings.},

  abstract     = {ABSTRACTGhosting (i.e., unilaterally ending a relationship by
                  cutting off all contact) is a poorly perceived but common
                  relationship dissolution strategy used to end romantic,
                  platonic, and other relationships. The experience of ghosting
                  elicits a range of emotional consequences including hurt
                  feelings and confusion in the person being ghosted and guilt
                  and relief in the person engaging in ghosting. Ghosting occurs
                  for a variety of reasons including believing that it is the
                  most appropriate form of rejection within digital contexts,
                  desire for ease, and safety concerns. Willingness to engage in
                  ghosting is associated with individual differences such as
                  attachment and implicit theories of relationships. We conclude
                  with suggestions for future research that highlight
                  methodological, as well as sample‐ and context‐based,
                  recommendations to better understand the nuances of ghosting
                  decisions and experiences as they unfold over time.},

                  media (SM) use and creativity. The data collected from 407
                  participants included indicators such as time spent using SM,
                  frequency of SM use, purposes for using SM, and the nature of
                  SM use. The data involved two aspects of creativity:
                  ideational behavior and creative activity and accomplishment.
                  Correlational analyses indicate that SM use is positively
                  related to both creativity measures. Overall, the active use
                  of SM (e.g., sending a post) is more related to creativity
                  than the passive use (e.g., reading others’ posts); and the
                  link between creativity and SM use is more evident for certain
                  platforms (i.e., Twitter) than others (e.g., Instagram).
                  Ideational behavior and creative activity were also found to
                  be higher among those who use SM primarily for expressing
                  their ideas and opinions, gleaning information on topics to
                  discuss and self‐education and learning compared with those
                  who use it primarily for entertainment or relaxation. None of
                  the creativity measures used was related to extraversion and
                  excessive use of SM. Our findings indicate that SM is not
                  necessarily a negative factor for creativity; it may even be a
                  useful platform to support new ideas and projects.},

                  analyzing the results of subject scales, these assessments
                  effectively evaluate physical and mental health status.
                  Traditional methods, based on statistical analysis, are
                  limited in accuracy due to their reliance on linear scoring
                  methods. Meanwhile, machine learning approaches, despite their
                  potential, have not been widely adopted due to their poor
                  interpretability and dependence on large amounts of training
                  data. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have gained

                  behaviour, empirical research on the causes of greed is
                  scarce. In this context, we propose that perceived economic
                  inequality may be an important factor influencing greed. Study
                  1 provided primary evidence of a positive relationship between
                  perceived economic inequality and greed, based on data from a
                  large‐scale social survey (CFPS 2018, N = 14,317). Employing
                  well‐established questionnaires, Study 2A (N = 200) and Study
                  2B (N = 399) revealed that perceived economic inequality
                  positively predicts greed, with relative deprivation playing a
                  mediating role. Study 3A (N = 200) and Study 3B (N = 200)
                  manipulated perceived economic inequality to provide causal
                  evidence of its effects on greed and to replicate the
                  mediating effect of relative deprivation. Finally, Study 4 (N
                  = 372), using a blockage manipulation design, showed that the
                  effect of perceived economic inequality on greed significantly
                  decreases when relative deprivation is suppressed. In summary,
                  the results of these six studies consistently suggest that
                  perceived economic inequality positively affects greed and
                  that this effect is mediated by relative deprivation.},

               interpersonal relations. In the context of this book, the term
               "interpersonal relations" denotes relations between a few,
               usually between two, people. How one person thinks and feels
               about another person, how he perceives him and what he does to
               him, what he expects him to do or think, how he reacts to the
               actions of the other--these are some of the phenomena that will
               be treated. Our concern will be with "surface" matters, the
               events that occur in everyday life on a conscious level, rather
               than with the unconscious processes studied by psychoanalysis in
               "depth" psychology. These intuitively understood and "obvious"
               human relations can, as we shall see, be just as challenging and
               psychologically significant as the deeper and stranger phenomena.
               The discussion will center on the person as the basic unit to be
               investigated. That is to say, the two-person group and its
               properties as a superindividual unit will not be the focus of
               attention. Of course, in dealing with the person as a member of a
               dyad, he cannot be described as a lone subject in an impersonal
               environment, but must be represented as standing in relation to
               and interacting with another person. The chapter topics included

                  City. These trip-level data contain information on pick-up and
                  drop-off times and locations, and trip distance. We analyze
                  over 280,000 taxi trips on weekday evenings between March and
                  September 2019. Under the assumption that taxi trips represent
                  traffic conditions in the city, the results indicate that
                  travel time increases on a game day. Travelers experience
                  1.3\% longer travel times on game days. Game-related traffic
                  increases travel time by 6.3\% for the trips that pass through
                  the stadium area, and by 17\% for trips before the game
                  starts. Local economic value of lost time from games amounts

  abstract     = {Interpersonal violence in sport has serious consequences for
                  athletes, sports organisations and society at large. Despite
                  recent advances in safeguarding sport participants from
                  interpersonal violence, empirical evidence regarding its
                  prevalence and risk factors across different sports remains
                  scarce. In this study, we investigated differences in the
                  prevalence of interpersonal violence among a convenience
                  sample of 9989 adults from six European countries who
                  participated in organised sport before age 18. Utilising
                  binary logistic regression analyses and CHAID regression tree
                  analyses, we examined variations in reported experiences of
                  neglect, psychological, physical, non-contact sexual and
                  contact sexual forms of interpersonal violence based on gender
                  and three sport classifications: type of sport (individual vs.
                  team), sports attire (non-revealing vs.
                  body-fitting/revealing) and weight-sensitivity (less
                  weight-sensitive vs. weight-sensitive sports). Men
                  participating in team sports reported significantly higher
                  levels of victimisation across all types of interpersonal
                  violence. Women in sports with non-revealing attire and men in
                  less weight-sensitive sports also reported higher prevalence
                  rates. The study underscores the need for a nuanced
                  understanding of interpersonal violence characteristics and
                  dynamics across different sports. Insights into the factors
                  influencing victimisation enable tailored prevention and
                  response strategies to be developed to better address the
                  needs of athletes and sport organisations.},

                  lyrics can increase the accessibility of prosocial thoughts,
                  leading to greater empathy and fostering helping behaviors.
                  However, existing studies have largely neglected the
                  intertemporal nature of altruism, limiting their scope of
                  interpretation. The present research investigates the effects
                  of attentively listening to music with prosocial lyrics (Study
                  1) and playing prosocial background music (Study 2) on
                  intertemporal charitable donations. Both studies indicated
                  that relative to neutral music, listening to songs with
                  prosocial lyrics enhanced intertemporal donation behavior.
                  Interpersonal empathy served a mediating role in this effect.
                  These findings align with the General Learning Model,

                  attention is costly. Our objective is to understand the
                  advertiser’s optimal decision for informational and
                  noninformational content when facing consumers with heavy
                  distractions common in the digital age. We take an equilibrium
                  approach in which an ad is consumed if and only if the content
                  of the ad is worth the viewer’s attention. We classify many
                  advertising decisions observed in practice. First, an
                  advertiser can structure content to induce curiosity for
                  continued viewing by showing the information that is
                  relatively less likely to resonate with the broad audience.
                  This tactic is evident in clickbait ads and “mystery ads.”
                  Second, we find that digital ads, which tend to be skippable,
                  have lower amounts of noninformational content (e.g.,
                  entertainment) relative to nonskippable ads. This finding can
                  explain the industry perception that ads on digital media are
                  of lower copy quality than traditional ads. This paper was

  abstract     = {Loving-kindness meditations involve sending feelings of
                  kindness and care to a series of people including oneself,
                  loved ones, strangers, and all beings. Loving-kindness
                  interventions (LKIs), which include knowledge and/or practice
                  related to loving-kindness, have been gaining attention as a
                  potential intervention for improving mental health in adults.
                  This meta-analysis synthesized the effects of LKIs on both
                  positive (i.e., mindfulness, compassion, positive affect) and
                  negative (i.e., negative affect, psychological symptoms)
                  indices of mental health across comparison types (i.e.,
                  passive control, active control, alternative treatment) and
                  general sample types (i.e., community, university), and
                  explored characteristics of LKIs that may impact their
                  effectiveness (i.e., intervention format, intervention length,
                  presence/absence of a live facilitator). Following a
                  systematic review of six databases in November 2023, 23
                  randomized controlled studies met eligibility criteria and
                  were included in the review. Relative to passive control
                  groups, LKIs had positive effects on mindfulness, compassion,
                  positive affect, negative affect, and psychological symptoms;
                  these effects were non-significant relative to active control
                  groups and alternative therapeutic treatments. Notably, the
                  effects of LKIs did not differ as a function of sample type,
                  intervention format, intervention length, or the
                  presence/absence of a live facilitator. Findings provide
                  support for the effectiveness of LKIs relative to passive
                  control conditions, as well as their potential comparability
                  to alternative evidence-based therapeutic treatments, and
                  provide insight into resource-effective approaches to the
                  delivery of effective LKIs. However, additional studies are
                  needed to confirm the impacts of LKIs relative to other
                  interventions in the field.},

                  others. We test the hypothesis that individuals with stronger
                  theory of mind skills and motivation garner more positive
                  first impressions because of how they interact with others.
                  Participants included 334 young adults who were paired with a
                  peer for a first-time meeting. Dyads completed a cooperative
                  Lego-building task, which was videotaped and later coded for
                  behavioral manifestations of theory of mind by independent
                  raters. Theory of mind accuracy and motivation were assessed
                  with validated laboratory tasks and a self-report
                  questionnaire, respectively. First impressions were assessed
                  based on partner's ratings of participant likeability,
                  enjoyment of the interaction, and changes in positive affect.
                  Results of actor-partner interdependence mediation models
                  revealed that the associations between theory of mind and
                  first impressions are indirect and mediated through behaviors.
                  Specifically, participants with stronger theory of mind
                  demonstrated greater cognitive sensitivity and pragmatic
                  conversational skills. However, only cognitive sensitivity
                  subsequently predicted more favorable first impressions. This
                  research shows that social-cognitive skills can affect others'
                  social impressions through their behavioral manifestations.

                  decisions-however, failing to report effect magnitudes might
                  lead to a potential bias in assuming findings are practically
                  significant. Across two online studies (Prolific; N = 800), we
                  measured U.S. adults' endorsements of expensive interventions
                  described in media reports that led to effects that were
                  small, large, or of unreported magnitude between groups.
                  Participants who viewed interventions with unreported effect
                  magnitudes were more likely to endorse interventions compared
                  with those who viewed interventions with small effects and
                  were just as likely to endorse interventions as those who
                  viewed interventions with large effects, suggesting a
                  practical significance bias. When effect magnitudes were
                  reported, participants on average adjusted their evaluations
                  accordingly. However, some individuals, such as those with low
                  numeracy skills, were more likely than others to act on small
                  effects, even when explicitly prompted to first consider the

                  sense of self confers a sense of certainty to the
                  self-concept. Study 1 provided initial evidence of the
                  influence of future self-continuity on feelings of meaning in
                  life (MIL) in a nationally representative sample. In Studies
                  2a and 2b, we manipulated future self-continuity by varying
                  the expectedness of one's future self, demonstrating the
                  causal influence of future self-continuity on self-certainty
                  and feelings of MIL. Study 3 again manipulated future
                  self-continuity, finding an indirect effect on feelings of
                  meaning in life via self-certainty. Our findings thus suggest
                  the experience of meaning in life arises from the perception

                  opposing political views carries reputational benefits. A
                  different body of research finds that opposing political views
                  and the people who hold them are seen as repugnant. How could
                  it be that people receptive to opposing political ideas are
                  viewed positively when the political opponents they are
                  receptive to are seen negatively? In seven main (N = 5,286)
                  and nine supplemental studies (N = 3,983 participants in
                  online studies; N = 124,493 observations in field data), we
                  reconcile this tension by arguing that the identity of the
                  person one is receptive to determines whether receptiveness
                  carries reputational benefits or costs. When the information
                  source belongs to the opposing party, receptiveness to
                  opposing political views often carries reputational costs. We
                  find these reputational costs across both strong and weak
                  signals of receptiveness, eight different political and social
                  issues, and multiple types of prototypical out-party sources.
                  We argue that these costs arise because members of the
                  opposing party are frequently stereotyped as immoral, and thus
                  receptiveness to their ideas is seen negatively. As a boundary
                  condition, we find that the costs of receptiveness are
                  pronounced for sources who are prototypical of the out-party
                  and attenuate (or even reverse) for sources who are
                  nonprototypical. These findings resolve a seeming
                  contradiction between two distinct literatures in psychology,
                  contribute to a rapidly expanding literature on the
                  interpersonal consequences of receptiveness, and lay the
                  groundwork for understanding novel barriers to, and ultimately
                  solutions for, the lack of cross-party openness and political
                  polarization. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all

                  on an abbreviated version of the Schwartz Value Survey (
                  Schwartz, 1992 ). A typology of music preferences was
                  revealed, with five factors: sophisticated and complex (e.g.,
                  jazz); native-Greek traditional (e.g., ‘rebetika’);
                  sentimental and sensational (e.g., pop); established

                  from Montréal (Canada) and had three objectives: (1) to find
                  empirical evidence that music listening in adolescence can
                  lead to peer affiliation based upon music preferences; (2) to
                  find out whether three styles of coping by music listening
                  (original self-report scale: emotion-oriented,
                  problem-oriented, and avoidance/disengagement) are related to
                  depression levels in adolescence (French version of the Beck
                  Depression Inventory: Bourque \& Beaudette, 1982); (3) to
                  examine whether peers' depression levels and coping by music
                  listening are moderators of the relation between Metal music
                  preference and depression levels in adolescent girls. The
                  results of a peer nomination procedure indicated that music
                  preferences and depression levels of participants are related
                  to those of their peers. In girls, problem-oriented coping by
                  music listening is linked to lower depression levels, whereas
                  avoidance/disengagement coping by music listening is linked to
                  higher depression levels. In boys, emotion-oriented coping by
                  music listening is linked to higher depression levels.
                  Finally, Metal music listening is related to higher depression
                  levels in girls only if they affiliate with peers that are
                  more depressed. The implications of the research regarding the
                  music listening and psychosocial development and adjustment in
                  adolescence are discussed.},

                  for the plight of others. The present study investigated
                  whether fans of aggressive heavy or death metal music show
                  reduced empathic reactions to aggression, relative to fans of
                  non-aggressive music. 108 participants who self-identified as
                  fans of heavy or death metal, classical or jazz music ( n=36
                  per group) were presented with vignettes that described a
                  primary character’s reaction (the ‘aggressor’) in response to
                  a secondary character’s irritating action (the ‘instigator’).
                  The aggressor’s reaction was either non-aggressive, mildly
                  aggressive or strongly aggressive. After each vignette,
                  participants provided ratings of state empathic concern
                  (other-oriented empathy) and personal distress (self-oriented
                  distress). They also completed measures of trait empathy,
                  passion for music and its psychosocial functions. Fans of
                  heavy or death metal exhibited lower trait empathic concern
                  compared with classical and jazz fans. However, only male
                  heavy or death metal fans exhibited lower state empathic
                  concern than male classical and jazz fans. Finally, social
                  bonding was a stronger motivation for heavy or death metal
                  fans to listen to music than for classical fans. Results are
                  discussed in light of research and public concern regarding

                  sociology of emotions by discussing and delimiting the concept
                  of “affective rupture.” According to this approach, emotions
                  emerge from the breaking of habits in the face of the
                  transformation of situations, producing reflexivity and
                  relational adjustments. The pragmatist approach problematizes
                  the “rhythm” of emotions, made up of ruptures, moments of
                  quiet, adjustments, harmonizations, restorations, and
                  relational revolutions. Rhythm is what emotions pragmatically
                  “do,” ordering and transforming every social situation. This
                  article employs this idea to reinterpret some sociological
                  approaches to emotions and, in parallel, to show how the

                  on the creative potential aspect (e.g., divergent thinking),

                  self‐belief (e.g., creative self‐efficacy) aspect of

                  assessments to ensure the measures' sound psychometric

                  However, this pattern can be amplified, eliminated, or
                  reversed depending on whether option descriptions include only
                  positive information (e.g., "200 people will be saved"), only
                  negative information (e.g., "400 people will not be saved"),

                  only when option descriptions are mismatched across frames.

                  participants ( Mage = 22.19 years, SD = 6) completed a music
                  preference inventory prior to listening to heavy metal and
                  classical music stimuli, presented in counterbalanced order.
                  Participants completed the Positive Affect and Negative Affect
                  Scale inventory to measure baseline mood and then re-completed
                  the inventory after each music stimulus presentation.
                  Multivariate analysis of variance on repeated measures
                  evaluated the effects of music type on mood, whereas multiple
                  regression analysis tested the influence of preference on mood
                  following music exposure. Heavy metal music induced a state of
                  high arousal/negative mood via increases in hostility, whereas
                  classical music induced a state of low arousal/positive mood

                  predicted significant reductions in negative affect and

                  negative affect triggered by daily stressors, has
                  well-established links to personal well-being. Prior work
                  conceptualized affective reactivity as an intrapersonal
                  phenomenon, reflecting reactions to one's own stressors. Here,
                  we conceptualized reactivity interpersonally, examining one's
                  responses to a romantic partner's daily stressors. Across four
                  longitudinal dyadic studies, we investigated how reactivity to
                  partner stress predicts relationship quality appraisals. In
                  fledgling couples, reactivity to a partner's stressors,
                  assessed via weekly (Study 1; N = 152) and daily (Study 2; N =
                  144) diaries, positively predicted partner relationship
                  quality. In both studies, the associations were mediated by
                  the partner's perceptions of responsiveness. Furthermore,
                  reactivity to partner stress buffered against declines in
                  partner relationship quality over 8 weeks in Study 1 and 13
                  months in Study 2. The relevance of reactivity to partner
                  stress for relationship quality diminished in the later stages
                  of relationships. Among samples of established couples
                  (Studies 3 and 4, Ns = 164 and 208, respectively), reactivity
                  to partner stress did not directly predict partner
                  relationship quality or moderate its trajectory over time.
                  Overall, the predominant pattern across four studies painted a
                  portrait of relational well-being benefits specific to
                  fledgling relationships. Through its novel framework of
                  situating affective reactivity interpersonally between
                  partners, the present research contributes to both affective
                  science and relationship science. (PsycInfo Database Record

                  Although some situations might allow persuaders to combine
                  these strategies, the present work examines how people select
                  targets and strategies when a natural trade-off exists between
                  acquiring fewer people with more extreme attitudes versus more
                  people with less extreme attitudes. Prior work suggests that
                  potential advantages exist for both extremity and consensus
                  strategies. However, the current research finds that people
                  exhibit a strong preference for a consensus strategy when
                  tasked with selecting targets in group persuasion contexts.
                  Further, this preference prevails even when consensus
                  strategies would backfire and cause one's persuasive efforts
                  to fail. This allure of consensus is demonstrated across eight
                  primary experiments, which also reveal why people are drawn to
                  a consensus strategy as well as explore potential boundary
                  conditions for this preference. This work has implications for
                  understanding how persuaders select targets and strategies in
                  the context of group persuasion. In addition, the paradigms
                  and results invite a host of new avenues for future research.

                  guided research for decades, with the core assumption that
                  emotions are functional-they improve outcomes for people.
                  Based on functional accounts of emotion, we theorized that
                  anger should improve goal attainment in the presence of
                  challenges. In seven studies, goal attainment was assessed in
                  situations that involved varying levels of challenges to goal
                  attainment. Across studies, anger compared to a neutral
                  condition resulted in behavior that facilitated greater goal
                  attainment on tasks that involved challenges. With a goal to
                  solve difficult puzzles, anger resulted in more puzzles
                  correctly solved (Study 1). With a goal to attain prizes,
                  anger increased cheating rates and numbers of unearned prizes
                  (Study 2). With a goal to do well in a video game, anger
                  increased scores on a game with challenges to be avoided, but
                  not other scores (Study 3). In two studies, examining the
                  consequences of anger in response to the challenging task that
                  was the focus of that anger, anger decreased reaction time
                  with goals to win trials (Study 4), and predicted making the
                  effort to vote in two contentious elections (Study 5). With a
                  goal to protect financial resources, anger increased action
                  taken to prevent loss compared to a physiological arousal
                  condition (Study 6). (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA,

                  individuals need to share information about their past
                  accomplishments. Broadcasting one's past accomplishments or
                  claiming credit to demonstrate competence, however, can harm
                  perceptions of warmth and likability. In fact, prior work has
                  conceptualized self-promotion as a hydraulic challenge:
                  tactics that boost perceptions along one dimension (e.g.,
                  competence) harm perceptions along other dimensions (e.g.,
                  warmth). In this work, we identify a novel approach to
                  self-promotion: We show that by combining self-promotion with
                  other-promotion (complimenting or giving credit to others),
                  which we term "dual-promotion," individuals can project both
                  warmth and competence to make better impressions on observers
                  than they do by only self-promoting. In seven preregistered
                  studies, including analyses of annual reports from members of
                  Congress and experiments using social network, workplace, and
                  political contexts (total N = 1,448), we show that individuals
                  who engage in dual-promotion create more favorable impressions
                  of warmth and competence than those who only engage in
                  self-promotion. The beneficial effects of dual-promotion are
                  robust to both competitive and noncompetitive contexts and
                  extend to behavioral intentions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c)

                  deprivation that has lasting implications for multiple aspects
                  of neurocognitive functioning, including executive function
                  (EF). Changes in brain development are thought to contribute
                  to these persistent EF challenges, but little research has
                  used fMRI to investigate EF-related brain activity in children
                  with a history of early deprivation. This study examined
                  behavioral and neural data from a response conflict task in
                  12-14-year-olds who spent varying lengths of time in
                  institutional care prior to adoption (N = 84; age at adoption
                  - mean: 15.85 months, median: 12 months, range: 4-60 months).
                  In initial analyses, earlier- and later-adopted (EA, LA) youth
                  were compared to a group of children raised in their
                  biological families (non-adopted, NA). NA youth performed
                  significantly more accurately than LA youth, with EA youth
                  falling in between. Imaging data suggested that previously
                  institutionalized (PI) youth activated additional
                  frontoparietal regions, including dorsolateral prefrontal
                  cortex, as compared to NA youth. In addition, EA youth
                  uniquely activated medial prefrontal regions, and LA uniquely
                  activated parietal regions during this task. A separate
                  analysis in a larger group of PI youth examined whether
                  behavioral or brain measures of EF varied with the duration of
                  deprivation experienced. Duration of deprivation was
                  negatively associated with activation of default mode network
                  (DMN) regions. Overall, results suggest that there are lasting
                  effects of deprivation on EF, but that those who are removed
                  from institutional care earlier may be able to recruit
                  additional neural resources as a compensatory mechanism.},

                  time. Our process model of practice preservation highlights
                  that a declining practice may persist across generations if it
                  is made more accessible and resilient by reducing its
                  dependence on specific types of meanings, materials, and
                  competences that risk being lost. Our analysis suggests that
                  these outcomes depend on the work of two types of
                  custodians—legacy professionals and new enthusiasts—in terms
                  of “diversifying” the practice to accommodate multiple
                  configurations of meanings, materials, and competences, thus
                  constituting new practice variants, as well as supporting the

                  examined the art bias across artistic, scientific,
                  business-oriented, and conventional occupations using implicit
                  and explicit methods. In a mixed design, participants (N =
                  722) responded to one of six Implicit Association Tests (where
                  two occupations were paired with creative and mundane words),
                  explicit measures of bias toward creativity across
                  occupations, and creative self-efficacy (CSE) in the same
                  occupations. Results indicated that artistic occupations
                  (e.g., poet) were most likely to be implicitly and explicitly
                  endorsed as creative compared to all other occupations. There
                  was no difference in perceived creativity among scientific and
                  business-oriented occupations; however, conventional ones were
                  uniformly assessed as the lowest on creativity. Further, one’s
                  CSE in specific occupations contributed to explicit creativity
                  bias across all four occupations. These results can aid the
                  field of vocational psychology and direct future research on
                  interventions that recognize and curb art bias. (PsycInfo

                  risk factor in psychopathology, is defined as a dispositional
                  incapacity to withstand uncertainty distress, driving
                  maladaptive cognitive, emotional and behavioural reactions to
                  uncertainty. However, the intricate interplay among these
                  components, particularly in adolescents, remains
                  underexplored; yet understanding this interplay is crucial for
                  supporting mental health. To address this gap, we employed a
                  network approach to conceptualize IU in 5672 non-clinical
                  Chinese adolescents (Mage = 14.13 years, SDage = 1.96 years,
                  range = 10-19 years, 46.6\% boys), combining graphical
                  Gaussian models (GGM) and directed acyclic graphs (DAG). Our
                  analyses revealed a tripartite network comprising cognitive,
                  behavioural and emotional components. Notably, 'frustration'
                  and 'work with hindrance' emerged as key drivers, while
                  'catastrophizing belief' served as a critical bridge linking
                  different components. These findings underscore the importance
                  of alleviating uncertainty-induced frustration and enhancing
                  coping skills for behavioural impediments to mitigate
                  adolescent IU. Additionally, therapeutic interventions should
                  prioritize modifying and re-evaluating catastrophizing beliefs
                  related to uncertainty.},

                  This research investigates when and how visual concealment
                  tactics may benefit or hurt aesthetic product evaluations. The
                  authors propose that when consumers are only able to view a
                  portion of an aesthetic product, assessments of its appeal
                  will be influenced by two interrelated mechanisms: curiosity
                  to see the item completed and inferences about the item’s
                  fully disclosed appearance. The authors show that heightened
                  curiosity triggers feelings of positive affect that are
                  transferred to the product itself, a process that may inflate
                  preferences and choice likelihoods for products beyond what
                  would occur if the full image were known. This transference
                  effect, however, has an important boundary: it works only when
                  initial consumer inferences about the appeal of the product
                  are positive or emotionally congruent with the positive affect
                  triggered by curiosity. The key implication is that,
                  ironically, the products likely to benefit most from
                  concealment tactics are those that have the least to hide. The
                  authors provide evidence for these effects and the underlying
                  mechanism using six experiments that manipulate concealment in
                  a variety of task settings.},

                  and choice overload},
  journaltitle = {Routledge handbook of bounded rationality},
  date         = {2021},
  abstract     = {In today’s world, people face an abundance of information and
                  a great number of choices both in important domains, such as
                  health care, retirement, and education, and in less important
                  domains, such as the choice of breakfast cereal or chocolate.
                  Choice overload and information overload have strong negative
                  effects on many important decision-making aspects such as
                  processing and using information, the motivation to act, the
                  quality of choices, and post-choice feelings, which are
                  discussed in Chapter 43 in this volume in more detail.
                  However, small choice and information sets are not always
                  optimal either. Several variables––such as information usage,
                  decision accuracy, motivation to choose, and satisfaction with
                  choice are “inverted” functions of the amount of information
                  and the number of choice alternatives available. In other
                  words, choosing from sets of an intermediate size usually
                  brings more net benefits to the decision-maker than choosing
                  from large or small choice sets. Indeed, in line with the
                  assumptions of bounded rationality, intermediate sizes are
                  preferable when they do not entail the same high, cognitively
                  unmanageable load that large sets do, and simultaneously
                  possess the benefits of variety that small sets lack. However,
                  exactly how much choice is enough, or, as Herbert A. Simon
                  would say, “good enough”? The size of the intermediate set is
                  not always clear or universal, and is often influenced by a
                  variety of factors. The aim of this chapter is to set out the
                  factors which most affect and moderate the experience of too
                  much choice, influencing feelings of how much is “enough.”
                  Broadly, there are two categories of moderators: one
                  pertaining to the choice environment and one pertaining to the
                  characteristics of the decision-making actor. This division is
                  in line with Simon’s scissors analogy (Simon, 1990), which
                  views bounded rationality as the interplay between the two
                  blades: the context or choice environment, on the one hand,
                  and the capabilities and characteristics of decision-makers,
                  on the other. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all

                  motivate people to identify with social groups, particularly

                  and associated normative beliefs and behavioral prescriptions.
                  This process can make more extreme groups and behaviors

                  maintaining physical distance. Furthermore, members of these
                  families must balance relational maintenance while
                  communicating to assess and avoid health risks. The ongoing
                  ambiguity of information about COVID-19 means that these
                  relational processes must be managed in the midst of chronic
                  uncertainty. The current study uses semistructured interviews
                  and interpretive analysis to understand how adult children
                  (aged 23-51 years) manage chronic uncertainty about COVID-19
                  in communication with their parents. Findings explore themes
                  of navigating information about COVID-19 risks and
                  protections, managing uncertainty management about media and
                  political messages, and accepting time-related uncertainties.},

                  attendance decisions, receives substantial attention in the
                  literature, including many papers published in this journal.
                  The standard model of fan decisions under uncertainty
                  generates two diametrically opposed predictions about the
                  COU-attendance relationship, depending on fan preferences,
                  generating tension in the empirical literature. We undertake a
                  meta-analysis of the empirical COU literature to assess
                  empirical support for these predictions. We identify more than
                  500 empirical model specifications reported in 97 COU papers.
                  The results slightly favor the loss aversion version of the
                  model, but the literature contains no consensus. Sport
                  analyzed and choice of COU proxy variable have no relationship

                  "Neuropsychology of Anxiety". It is based on two behavioural
                  dimensions: 'defensive distance' as defined by the Blanchards
                  and 'defensive direction'. Defensive direction is a
                  categorical dimension with avoidance of threat corresponding
                  to fear and approach to threat corresponding to anxiety. These
                  two psychological dimensions are mapped to underlying neural
                  dimensions. Defensive distance is mapped to neural level, with
                  the shortest defensive distances involving the lowest neural
                  level (periaqueductal grey) and the largest defensive
                  distances the highest neural level (prefrontal cortex).
                  Defensive direction is mapped to separate parallel streams
                  that run across these levels. A significant departure from
                  prior models is the proposal that both fear and anxiety are
                  represented at all levels. The theory is presented in a
                  simplified form that does not incorporate the interactions
                  that must occur between non-adjacent levels of the system. It
                  also requires expansion to include the dimension of
                  escapability of threat. Our current development and these
                  proposed future extensions do not change the core concepts
                  originally proposed by Gray and, we argue, demonstrate their

                  been claimed to be one of the mechanisms through which
                  intolerance of uncertainty (IU) may play its causal role in
                  the development and maintenance of several anxiety and
                  compulsive disorders. Consistently, Flores et al. (2018) found
                  that individuals with higher Prospective IU (P-IU), a specific
                  IU subfactor, display excessive avoidance response repetitions
                  in a free-operant discriminative task to avoid an aversive
                  noise. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that P-IU
                  not only predicts the amount of avoidance responses but also
                  how well the temporal distribution of such responses fits the
                  temporal distribution of threats. METHODS: Further correlation
                  and hierarchical regression analysis of Flores et al.'s (2018)
                  data served to test this hypothesis. We evaluated two aspects
                  of the temporal distribution of responses: a) for how long
                  participants were performing the responses; b) the behavioral
                  discrimination between threatening and safe time periods.
                  RESULTS: The results showed that scoring high in P-IU was
                  positively associated with longer periods of time dedicated to
                  avoiding and with worse behavioral discrimination between
                  threatening and safe time periods. Hierarchical regression
                  analyses indicated that later addition of inhibitory
                  intolerance of uncertainty and trait anxiety did not
                  significantly improved the explained variance. LIMITATIONS:
                  Our results are exclusively based on the use of a low-cost
                  avoidance response, and the present study does not clarify the
                  precise mechanisms that lead high P-IU people to engage in
                  non-optimal avoidance response distribution through time.
                  CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that excessive avoidance is
                  also driven by uncertainty of threat timing and highlight the
                  relevance of P-IU as a vulnerability factor for excessive and
                  outspread avoidance behaviors.},

                  evaluating completed studies) in the context of new

                  underlying power, new quantitative developments in power
                  analysis, and the application of power analysis in designing
                  studies. To facilitate the pedagogy of using power for design,
                  we provide web applications to illustrate these concepts and
                  examples of power analysis using newly developed methods. We

  abstract     = {ABSTRACTThe exponential growth of the online luxury resale
                  market has spurred a notable shift toward a circular economy,
                  reflecting the increasing consumer preference for pre‐owned
                  luxury items. Nevertheless, this growth presents challenges
                  related to product authenticity and seller credibility. In
                  response to these concerns, blockchain technology (BT) emerges
                  as a promising solution, leveraging a decentralized ledger to
                  enhance transparency and reduce information asymmetry. This
                  allows for the traceability of pre‐owned luxury goods,
                  addressing issues of provenance and authenticity in the online
                  resale space. By incorporating regulatory focus theory into
                  the uncertainty reduction theory, this study examines how
                  approach and avoidance motivations impact evaluations of
                  BT‐enabled platforms to effectively mitigate consumer
                  uncertainties and influence trust. The collected data (N= 511)
                  was analyzed through partial least squares structural equation
                  modeling (PLS‐SEM; study 1), and a complementary qualitative
                  study (study 2) was additionally conducted. Results reveal
                  that distinct motivations coexist, each following separate
                  pathways to build consumer trust. Findings indicate that an
                  approach orientation mindset highly values the reliability of
                  BT‐enabled information, while an avoidance orientation focuses
                  on risk mitigation and expresses heightened uncertainty in
                  online transactions. Consequently, BT is found to be
                  instrumental in reducing consumer concerns about purchasing
                  pre‐owned luxury products. The study contributes to the
                  existing literature by shedding light on the psychological
                  dynamics influencing consumer trust in BT‐enabled platforms,
                  has implications for luxury retailers contemplating BT
                  integration, and offers insights into consumer behavior that
                  can inform strategies to enhance perceived trust in online
                  luxury resale.},

                  on uncertainty-identity theory, three studies (total N =

                  respondents. Studies 1 and 2 were secondary analyses of
                  American National Election Survey (ANES) 2012 and 2016 data.
                  They supported our key hypotheses in explaining support for
                  the populist American Tea Party (Study 1, N = 1,917), and

                  demand is a deterministic function of the price. However,
                  demand is usually stochastic and hence stock‐outs can occur.
                  Policy makers who consider the impact of different regulations
                  on Consumer Surplus often ignore the impact of demand
                  uncertainty. We present a definition of the Consumer Surplus
                  under stochastic demand. We then use this definition to study
                  the impact of demand and supply uncertainty on consumers in
                  several cases (additive and multiplicative demand noise). We
                  show that, in many cases, demand uncertainty hurts consumers.
                  We also derive analytical bounds on the ratio of the Consumer

                  First, researchers have used different operational definitions
                  of source importance and none adequately measure these
                  sources' impact on decision making. For example, in using the
                  percentage of respondents who report being exposed to a source
                  while making a decision [2, 5], there is no necessary
                  relationship between exposure and influence. Also, measures of
                  effectiveness (see [8] for a categorization) provide only a
                  partial indication of source impact since the data do not show
                  the degree to which sources influenced decisions. Finally, a
                  five-point scale asking how "helpful" a source was in reaching
                  a decision [9] has been developed, but it does not show how a
                  source affected existing information states, the affective
                  dimension of respondents' attitudes, or predispositions. A
                  second methodological problem, caused by lack of control in
                  field studies, is distinguishing the influence of the source
                  from the influence of the information content.},

                  as an explanation for worry within the context of generalized
                  anxiety disorder. However, recent research has identified
                  intolerance of uncertainty (IU) as a possible transdiagnostic
                  maintaining factor across the anxiety disorders and
                  depression. The aim of this study was to determine whether IU
                  mediated the relationship between neuroticism and symptoms
                  related to various anxiety disorders and depression in a
                  treatment-seeking sample (N=328). Consistent with previous
                  research, IU was significantly associated with neuroticism as
                  well as with symptoms of social phobia, panic disorder and
                  agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalized
                  anxiety disorder, and depression. Moreover, IU explained
                  unique variance in these symptom measures when controlling for
                  neuroticism. Mediational analyses showed that IU was a
                  significant partial mediator between neuroticism and all
                  symptom measures, even when controlling for symptoms of other
                  disorders. More specifically, anxiety in anticipation of
                  future uncertainty (prospective anxiety) partially mediated
                  the relationship between neuroticism and symptoms of
                  generalized anxiety disorder (i.e. worry) and
                  obsessive-compulsive disorder, whereas inaction in the face of
                  uncertainty (inhibitory anxiety) partially mediated the
                  relationship between neuroticism and symptoms of social
                  anxiety, panic disorder and agoraphobia, and depression.
                  Sobel's test demonstrated that all hypothesized meditational
                  pathways were associated with significant indirect effects,
                  although the mediation effect was stronger for worry than
                  other symptoms. Potential implications of these findings for
                  the treatment of anxiety disorders and depression are

                  regions that is consistently more engaged when people think
                  about the minds of other people than when they engage in
                  nonsocial tasks. Activations in this "mentalizing network" are
                  sometimes interpreted as evidence for the domain-specificity
                  of cognitive processes supporting social thought. Here, we
                  examine the alternative possibility that at least some
                  activations in the mentalizing network may be explained by
                  uncertainty. A reconsideration of findings from existing
                  functional MRI studies in light of new data from independent
                  raters suggests that (a) social tasks used in past studies
                  have higher levels of uncertainty than their nonsocial

                  associated with social cognition, the dorsomedial prefrontal

                  surrounding both social and nonsocial inferences. These
                  observations suggest that the preferential DMPFC response
                  observed consistently in social scenarios may reflect the

                  reduction, which points to avenues for future research into

                  strategic entrepreneurship and craft‐based ventures, focusing
                  on the integration of materiality, authenticity, and tradition
                  in the creation of competitive advantage. Craft, historically
                  rooted in artisanal, small‐scale production, has evolved into
                  “advanced craft,” requiring high expertise while also engaging
                  with modern economic goals such as scaling, technological
                  adoption, and global value chains. Craft‐based strategic
                  entrepreneurship embraces creativity and innovation, alongside
                  traditional values and high‐quality production, to engage with
                  the modern economy without the alienating effects of
                  industrialization. We highlight how craft entrepreneurs
                  balance the pursuit of innovation with the preservation of
                  authenticity and heritage. By examining the materiality,
                  authenticity, and tradition embedded in craft, our work
                  contributes to the understanding of how these elements
                  influence competitive advantage and the broader relationship
                  between economy and society in entrepreneurial
                  ventures.Managerial SummaryWe offer practical insights for
                  owners and managers in craft‐based ventures seeking to balance
                  tradition with modern business strategies. As the craft sector
                  evolves into “advanced craft,” entrepreneurs must integrate
                  artisanal expertise with scalable operations, technology
                  adoption, and global market engagement. We highlight how
                  successful craft ventures maintain high quality, authenticity,
                  and cultural heritage while embracing strategic
                  entrepreneurship practices like innovation, planning, and
                  partnerships with larger organizations. For owners and
                  managers, the key takeaway is the importance of preserving the
                  unique values of craftsmanship—such as materiality,
                  authenticity, and tradition—while also adopting modern tools
                  like advanced technology and marketing strategies to scale and
                  compete. By understanding these dynamics, craft‐based
                  businesses can enhance their competitive advantage, foster
                  meaningful customer engagement, and navigate challenges like
                  technological disruption and market expansion without losing
                  their core identity.},

                  approach for analyzing cross-classified data in psychology,
                  education research, and other fields. However, when the focus
                  of a study is on the regression coefficients at Level 1 rather
                  than on the random effects, ordinary least squares regression
                  with cluster robust variance estimators (OLS-CRVE) or fixed
                  effects regression with CRVE (FE-CRVE) could be appropriate
                  approaches. These alternative methods are potentially
                  advantageous because they rely on weaker assumptions than
                  those required by CCREM. We conducted a Monte Carlo Simulation
                  study to compare the performance of CCREM, OLS-CRVE, and
                  FE-CRVE in models, including conditions where homoscedasticity
                  assumptions and exogeneity assumptions held and conditions
                  where they were violated, as well as conditions with unmodeled
                  random slopes. We found that CCREM out-performed the
                  alternative approaches when its assumptions are all met.
                  However, when homoscedasticity assumptions are violated,
                  OLS-CRVE and FE-CRVE provided similar or better performance
                  than CCREM. When the exogeneity assumption is violated, only
                  FE-CRVE provided adequate performance. Further, OLS-CRVE and
                  FE-CRVE provided more accurate inferences than CCREM in the
                  presence of unmodeled random slopes. Thus, we recommend
                  two-way FE-CRVE as a good alternative to CCREM, particularly
                  if the homoscedasticity or exogeneity assumptions of the CCREM
                  might be in doubt. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all

                  early-life determinants of cognitive development in a large
                  cohort study are presented. The simulation results illustrate

                  factors in observational data. In the illustrative
                  application, plausible candidates for early-life determinants

  abstract     = {Research on curiosity has undergone 2 waves of intense
                  activity. The 1st, in the 1960s, focused mainly on curiosity's
                  psychological underpinnings. The 2nd, in the 1970s and 1980s,
                  was characterized by attempts to measure curiosity and assess
                  its dimensionality. This article reviews these contributions
                  with a concentration on the 1st wave. It is argued that
                  theoretical accounts of curiosity proposed during the 1st
                  period fell short in 2 areas: They did not offer an adequate
                  explanation for why people voluntarily seek out curiosity, and
                  they failed to delineate situational determinants of
                  curiosity. Furthermore, these accounts did not draw attention
                  to, and thus did not explain, certain salient characteristics
                  of curiosity: its intensity, transience, association with
                  impulsivity, and tendency to disappoint when satisfied. A new
                  account of curiosity is offered that attempts to address these
                  shortcomings. The new account interprets curiosity as a form
                  of cognitively induced deprivation that arises from the
                  perception of a gap in knowledge or understanding. (PsycINFO

                  experimental settings, people experienced a positive event
                  (e.g., received an unexpected gift of a dollar coin attached
                  to an index card) under conditions of certainty or uncertainty
                  (e.g., it was easy or difficult to make sense of the text on
                  the card). As predicted, people's positive moods lasted longer
                  in the uncertain conditions. The results were consistent with
                  a pleasure paradox, whereby the cognitive processes used to
                  make sense of positive events reduce the pleasure people
                  obtain from them. Forecasters seemed unaware of this paradox;
                  they overwhelmingly preferred to be in the certain conditions

                  primary intention of acquiring a life experience--made them

                  more likely to anticipate that experiences would make them
                  happier than material possessions after adopting a temporally
                  distant, versus a temporally proximate, perspective. The
                  discussion focuses on evidence that experiences make people

                  test models for integrating the concept of motivation to
                  reduce uncertainty into the axiomatic structure of uncertainty
                  reduction theory. Multiple models were considered, each model
                  defining motivation to reduce uncertainty in a different way.
                  Motivation to reduce uncertainty was defined as a scope
                  condition (Model 2), as tolerance for uncertainty (Model 3),
                  as a weighted function of uncertainty by its importance (Model
                  4), and as the difference between one's uncertainty level and
                  one's tolerance for uncertainty (Models 5a and 5b). Each of
                  these models was compared to the baseline model (Model 1)
                  derived from the original presentation of the theory where
                  level of uncertainty, by itself, serves as a determinant of
                  various communication behaviors. Tests of these models in
                  terms of their ability to predict information seeking and
                  attraction reveal that none of the models provides a
                  consistent integration of motivation to reduce uncertainty
                  into uncertainty reduction theory. Rather, tolerance for
                  uncertainty (Model 3) is one of three determinants of
                  information seeking, while level of uncertainty (Model 1) is
                  one of three determinants of attraction. This inability to
                  integrate motivation to reduce uncertainty into uncertainty
                  reduction theory can be attributed to the consistent failure
                  to find support for deviance and incentive value as
                  determinants of tolerance for uncertainty, the rejection of
                  Axiom 3 in uncertainty reduction theory (which specifies a
                  positive relationship between uncertainty and information
                  seeking), and the rejection of Theorem 17 (which specifies a
                  negative relationship between information seeking and liking).},

                  examined in many different disciplines. However,
                  interdisciplinary integration has not been forthcoming.
                  Classic theories of decision-making have not been amply
                  revised in light of greater empirical data on actual patterns
                  of decision-making behavior. Furthermore, the meta-theoretical
                  framework of evolution by natural selection has been largely
                  ignored in theories of decision-making under risk in the human
                  behavioral sciences. In this review, I critically examine four
                  of the most influential theories of decision-making from
                  economics, psychology, and biology: expected utility theory,
                  prospect theory, risk-sensitivity theory, and heuristic
                  approaches. I focus especially on risk-sensitivity theory,
                  which offers a framework for understanding decision-making
                  under risk that explicitly involves evolutionary
                  considerations. I also review robust empirical evidence for
                  individual differences and environmental/situational factors
                  that predict actual risky decision-making that any general
                  theory must account for. Finally, I offer steps toward
                  integrating various theoretical perspectives and empirical
                  findings on risky decision-making.},

                  definitions related to quadratic measures of variation. We

                  as a standard measure of explanatory power. In its intuitive

                  original artist (contagion). Across 5 experiments,
                  participants were exposed to hypothetical scenarios in which
                  an original object was duplicated. The type of object varied
                  across experiments (e.g., a painting vs. a piece of furniture)

                  human creativity? Our research uses a psychological lens to
                  explore these questions in the realm of visual art. We find
                  that people devalue art labeled as AI-made across a variety of
                  dimensions, even when they report it is indistinguishable from
                  human-made art, and even when they believe it was produced

  abstract     = {Individuals and social systems are often portrayed as risk
                  averse and resistant to change. Such propensities are
                  characteristically attributed to individual, organizational,
                  and cultural traits such as risk aversion,
                  uncertainty-avoidance, discounting, and an unwillingness to
                  change. This paper explores an alternative interpretation of
                  such phenomena. We show how the reproduction of successful
                  actions inherent in adaptive processes, such as learning and
                  competitive selection and reproduction, results in a bias
                  against alternatives that initially may appear to be worse
                  than they actually are. In particular, learning and selection
                  are biased against both risky and novel alternatives. Because
                  the biases are products of the tendency to reproduce success
                  that is inherent in the sequential sampling of adaptation,
                  they are reduced whenever the reproduction of success is
                  attenuated. In particular, when adaptation is slowed, made
                  imprecise, or recalled less reliably, the propensity to engage
                  in risky and new activities is increased. These protections
                  against the error of rejecting potentially good alternatives
                  on inadequate experiential evidence are costly, however. They
                  increase the likelihood of persisting with alternatives that
                  are poor in the long run as well as in the short run.},

                  AI‐powered Go program (APG) that unexpectedly outperformed the
                  best professional player. We compare the move quality of
                  professional players to APG's superior solutions around its
                  public release. Our analysis of 749,190 moves demonstrates
                  significant improvements in players' move quality, especially
                  in the early stages of the game where uncertainty is highest.
                  This improvement was accompanied by a higher alignment with
                  AI's suggestions and a decreased number and magnitude of
                  errors. Young players show greater improvement, suggesting

                  can learn from artificial intelligence (AI) by studying an
                  AI‐powered Go program (APG) that outperformed the best
                  professional player. By analyzing 749,190 moves, we find that
                  players' move quality improved significantly, closely aligning
                  with the AI's recommendations. The number and magnitude of
                  errors also decreased. This learning effect was particularly
                  strong early in the game where decisions are more uncertain.
                  Young players showed greater effect, suggesting that learning
                  from AI may vary by age. While players of all skill levels
                  benefited, those with less skill saw the greatest improvement.
                  These findings highlight the instructional role of AI and
                  offer guidance on how to effectively integrate AI into

                  research investigates the anticipated and experienced
                  enjoyment associated with the use of luxury goods. We propose
                  that anticipated and actual use of luxury goods have different
                  effects on enjoyment, which we refer to as the paradox of
                  enjoyment in luxury consumption. In the first study, the
                  majority of women (74.8\%) believed that using a luxury
                  handbag (vs. an ordinary handbag) would contribute to a higher
                  level of enjoyment/happiness. Our second study showed that
                  imagined use of a luxury handbag led to greater enjoyment than
                  imagined use of an ordinary handbag. Conversely, the results
                  of the third study showed that the actual use of a luxury
                  handbag reduced enjoyment, driven by an increase in feelings
                  of inauthenticity. The results of the fourth study confirmed
                  this mechanism using a different luxury brand. Furthermore, we
                  found that the actual use of a luxury handbag increased
                  enjoyment, but only among individuals with high levels of
                  brand engagement in self‐concept. Overall, the results show
                  that young women's expected enjoyment of using a luxury
                  product does not consistently match their actual emotional

                  Vicious Cycle of Status Insecurity. We define status
                  insecurity as doubting whether one is respected and admired by
                  others. Status insecurity leads people to view status as a
                  limited and zero-sum resource, where a boost in the status of
                  one individual inherently decreases that of other individuals.
                  As a result, the insecure become reluctant to share status in
                  the form of highlighting the contributions of others. However,
                  we suggest this reluctance to give others credit is often
                  counterproductive. In contrast to the zero-sum beliefs of the
                  insecure, we propose that giving credit to others boosts the
                  status of both the sharer and the recipient, expanding the
                  overall status pie. Because the insecure miss opportunities to
                  gain status by not elevating others, they reinforce their
                  initial insecurity. We provide evidence for this vicious cycle
                  across 17 studies, including a content analysis of people's
                  personal experiences with status insecurity, an archival
                  analysis of the final speeches held on the reality TV show
                  Survivor (using ChatGPT), and more than a dozen experimental
                  studies. To enhance generalizability and external validity,
                  our experimental contexts include consulting pitches, venture
                  capital competitions, and idea generation contests. To
                  demonstrate discriminant validity, we differentiate status
                  insecurity from self-esteem insecurity. Across the studies,
                  status insecurity consistently decreased status sharing while
                  status sharing reliably increased one's status. Ultimately,
                  status insecurity paradoxically lowers one's status because it
                  reduces the propensity to elevate and celebrate others.

                  a life history perspective, we examine the stereotypes people
                  hold about those who live in relatively harsh and
                  unpredictable ecologies. First, across diverse demographic
                  groups and societies (the United States, India, Japan,
                  Romania, the United Kingdom), people believe that individuals
                  who live in harsh and unpredictable environments engage in
                  "faster" behaviors (n = 2,078; ds from .80 to 2.14)-that they
                  are more impulsive, sexually unrestricted, opportunistic, and
                  invest less in education and their own children (Studies 1, 2,
                  and 3). Second, these ecology stereotypes seem to underlie
                  certain Black/White race stereotypes held by White perceivers
                  in the United States (Study 1) and family structure
                  stereotypes (i.e., growing up in a single-mother home) held by
                  perceivers in both Japan and the United States (Studies 4a and
                  5a). Supporting this, the application of these race and family
                  structure stereotypes is overridden or attenuated when
                  perceivers are presented with direct information about a
                  specific person's ecology (Studies 1, 4A, and 5B). Third,
                  beliefs that there is high ecological mobility within a
                  society reduce the magnitude of ecology stereotypes (Study 3),
                  as one would expect if ecology stereotypes function to help
                  perceivers better predict others' behavior. Last, ecology
                  stereotypes do not seem to be just general valence biases or
                  to simply reflect social class stereotypes. In sum, ecology
                  stereotypes may be an influential but relatively unexamined
                  type of stereotype, with broad implications for thinking about
                  other group stereotypes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025

                  research studying this phenomenon has been lacking. Across six
                  studies, this research seeks to provide a better understanding
                  of cringe, both in terms of what it is as an emotion and what
                  it does via its downstream consequences on consumer behavior.
                  The authors delineate conceptually and empirically how cringe
                  is a unique form of vicarious embarrassment (i.e.,
                  embarrassment experienced in response to someone else).
                  Specifically, they show that cringe occurs when one observes
                  an actor—an individual, group of people, or even a
                  brand—commit a social transgression by making an awkward
                  attempt to form a positive impression on others in a way that
                  is not excusable from the observer's perspective. The authors
                  also demonstrate a novel effect of cringe: consumers respond
                  to cringeworthy experiences by wanting to share them with
                  others via word of mouth. This effect occurs because the act
                  of sharing cringeworthy experiences gives consumers an
                  opportunity for self-enhancement by engaging in a favorable
                  downward social comparison to the actor committing the social
                  transgression that elicited cringe. Theoretical contributions,
                  managerial implications, and future research directions

  abstract     = {Do shared mental models support proactive problem-solving?
                  Research on shared cognition suggests that shared mental
                  models aid team performance by improving coordination between
                  team members’ actions. However, these models can also lead to
                  groupthink, potentially diminishing team members’ proactive
                  problem-solving behaviors. Based on social identity theory,
                  this study examines how shared mental models influence
                  proactive problem-solving at the individual and team levels.
                  We propose that shared mental models about work tasks and team
                  dynamics are crucial for promoting proactive problem-solving
                  behaviors and coordinating team efforts. To test our theory,
                  we conducted multilevel path analyses with survey data from
                  266 individuals across 48 teams in 13 Italian manufacturing
                  companies. Our results indicate that the degree to which
                  individuals align their task- and team-related mental models
                  impacts both their tendency to proactively solve problems and
                  their ability to coordinate team problem-solving. We also find
                  that the adoption of proactive problem-solving behaviors and
                  team effort coordination are linked to enhanced team
                  performance.},

                  person can spend time with others is through a
                  self-invitation-asking to join the plans of others. We address
                  the psychological processes involved with self-invitations to
                  everyday social activities from both the self-inviter's
                  perspective and the perspective of those with the plans
                  ("plan-holders"). Across eight studies (seven preregistered),
                  we demonstrate that potential self-inviters fail to ask to
                  join the plans of others as often as plan-holders would
                  prefer, because potential self-inviters overestimate how
                  irritated plan-holders would be by such self-invitations.
                  Further, we show that these asymmetries are rooted in
                  differing viewpoints about the mindsets of plan-holders when
                  they originally made the plans. Namely, potential
                  self-inviters exaggerate the likelihood that plan-holders had

                  self-fulfilling prophecy that buffers the changes in

                  conflicting, explanations for why humor is strongly desired in
                  a mate. The present research asks whether humor is interpreted
                  as a reliable, hard-to-fake indicator of some other, valuable
                  trait. Across six experiments, we manipulated humor in a
                  hypothetical date, online dating profile, or video profile and
                  asked which of several traits statistically linked to humor
                  are reliably inferred about funny partners. Humor-specifically
                  partners producing humor-consistently led to higher ratings of
                  partner creative ingenuity. This effect was not moderated by
                  gender, and mediated desirability for different types of
                  partnership. Results further revealed stronger preference for
                  a first-date activity requiring creative ingenuity with a
                  funny versus non-funny partner. Humor may signal that a
                  potential partner is skilled at creative problem-solving,
                  which may be particularly important when considering various
                  forms of partnership.},

                  passing quickly when reflecting on past periods of their
                  lives. A traditional cognitive account proposes that routine
                  experienced during a period decreases the number of memorable
                  events, making that period appear short in retrospect. A
                  motivational account derived from self-determination theory
                  proposes that a period remembered as lacking self-determined
                  growth feels unsatisfying or wasted, and thus seems to pass
                  quickly. Two exploratory studies (N = 999) did not
                  consistently support these accounts, although in Study 2
                  remembered routine predicted faster perceived pace, as
                  hypothesized. Contrary to our motivational account, remembered
                  growth positively, rather than negatively, predicted pace.
                  Interpreting this unexpected finding, we conducted two
                  pre-registered studies (N = 965) exploring how satisfaction
                  with, and nostalgic longing for, periods of growth contribute
                  to the perception of time passing quickly. Our findings have

                  different types of social consumption

                  respect to congruency with a social partner on up to three

                  common assumption is that such bonds partly endure, such that
                  former partners continue to fulfill attachment-related needs
                  partially. Another perspective holds that former attachment
                  bonds are relinquished such that there is eventually no
                  residual tie. The present study ( N = 320) adjudicates between
                  these alternatives. Results indicate that, for the average
                  person, attachment bonds are gradually (4.18 years as a
                  mid-point) relinquished after relationship termination:
                  People’s former partners simply become someone they used to
                  know. Results also indicate that the persistence of these
                  bonds is moderated by several factors, including attachment
                  orientations and continued contact with exes. Thus, even if
                  the typical person does eventually “get over” their former

  abstract     = {Prior research suggests that employees benefit from highly
                  passionate teammates because passion spreads easily from one
                  employee to the next. We develop theory to propose that life
                  in high-passion teams may not be as uniformly advantageous as
                  previously assumed. We suggest that high-passion teams also
                  evoke pressures that lead employees to expend effort to
                  increase their levels of passion, which negates the benefits
                  the team provides. We first conducted an experience-sampling
                  study at an engineering company involved in the production and
                  maintenance of critical infrastructure that benefits the
                  greater good, with 829 employees nested in 155 teams, which we
                  surveyed three times per day for 20 consecutive work days.
                  These data show that employees caught their teammates’ passion
                  and consequently reported better performance, lower emotional
                  exhaustion, and a stronger sense of social connection.
                  However, these benefits coexisted alongside costs employees
                  incurred that were associated with increasing their passion.
                  In a subsequent pre-registered experiment ( N = 1,063), we
                  provide causal evidence for these effects and their underlying
                  mechanism, finding that passion contagion is particularly
                  effort-laden—more so than contagion of other states and
                  increases in passion that are not the result of contagion. We
                  develop a theory of differentiated passion contagion that
                  exposes the effort inherent in contagion and the implications
                  of that effort. Our work suggests that passion caught from
                  others may hold less value than passion incited from within,
                  and shifts our understanding of when and why passion for work
                  is beneficial and detrimental. We also discuss implications
                  for broader emotional contagion theory.},

                  theory of variation in human LH strategies. The theory posits
                  that clusters of correlated LH traits (e.g., timing of
                  puberty, age at sexual debut and first birth, parental
                  investment strategies) lie on a slow-to-fast continuum; that
                  harshness (externally caused levels of morbidity-mortality)
                  and unpredictability (spatial-temporal variation in harshness)
                  are the most fundamental environmental influences on the
                  evolution and development of LH strategies; and that these
                  influences depend on population densities and related levels
                  of intraspecific competition and resource scarcity, on age
                  schedules of mortality, on the sensitivity of
                  morbidity-mortality to the organism's resource-allocation
                  decisions, and on the extent to which environmental
                  fluctuations affect individuals versus populations over short
                  versus long timescales. These interrelated factors operate at
                  evolutionary and developmental levels and should be

                  traits and are hierarchically operative in terms of primacy of
                  influence. Although converging lines of evidence support core

                  mate, coalition partner or competitor, and therefore results
                  in advantageous alliances for those signaling in this manner.
                  Our model is framed as a multi-player public goods game that
                  involves no repeated or assortative interactions, so that
                  non-cooperation would be a dominant strategy if there were no
                  signaling benefits. We show that honest signaling of
                  underlying quality by providing a public good to group members
                  can be evolutionarily stable, and can proliferate in a

                  fast and frugal heuristics programs have radically broken with
                  mainstream decision science, moving beyond the confines of
                  artificial tasks and safe academic laboratories. We document
                  commonalities of these programs and discuss ways in which a
                  synthesis could contribute to a more relevant, precise,
                  predictive, and effective decision science. We begin by
                  reviewing the common roots and philosophies of the two
                  programs, such as their respect for the capable decision maker
                  and their acknowledgment of the importance of task ecology. We
                  then identify four specific areas of synergetic potential,

                  (foraging birds and insects), the coefficient of variation
                  (CV), a measure of risk per unit of return, predicts choices
                  far better than outcome variance, the risk measure of
                  normative models. In a meta-analysis of human risk preference,
                  the superiority of the CV over variance in predicting risk
                  taking is not as strong. Two experiments show that people's
                  risk sensitivity becomes strongly proportional to the CV when
                  they learn about choice alternatives like other animals, by
                  experiential sampling over time. Experience-based choices
                  differ from choices when outcomes and probabilities are
                  numerically described. Zipf's law as an ecological regularity
                  and Weber's law as a psychological regularity may give rise to
                  the CV as a measure of risk.},

  abstract  = {NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER Two systems drive the way we think and
               make choices, Daniel Kahneman explains: System One is fast,
               intuitive, and emotional; System Two is slower, more
               deliberative, and more logical. Examining how both systems
               function within the mind, Kahneman exposes the extraordinary
               capabilities as well as the biases of fast thinking and the
               pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and
               our choices. Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about
               how we think, he shows where we can trust our intuitions and how
               we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking, contrasting the
               two-system view of the mind with the standard model of the
               rational economic agent. Kahneman's singularly influential work
               has transformed cognitive psychology and launched the new fields
               of behavioral economics and happiness studies. In this
               path-breaking book, Kahneman shows how the mind works, and offers
               practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in
               both our business and personal lives--and how we can guard
               against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble.},

                  is a heritable basis to some of this variation, but the
                  environment plays an important role in shaping individuals'
                  risk-taking propensity as well. This chapter describes some of
                  the challenges in studying the genetic basis of individual
                  differences in risk-taking behavior, arguing new insights will
                  emerge from studies which take a whole-genome approach and
                  which simultaneously consider both genetic and environmental
                  influences on the behavior. The availability of genomic tools
                  for three-spined stickleback, a small fish renowned for its
                  variable behavior, opens up new possibilities for studying the
                  genetic basis of natural, adaptive variation in risk-taking
                  behavior. After introducing the general biology of
                  sticklebacks, the chapter summarizes the existing literature

                  genes related to risk-taking behavior in this species.

               programs or robots. Their interactions can either be cooperative
               (for example as in an ant colony) or selfish (as in a free market

  abstract     = {The “co-creation” label has proliferated over the past decade.
                  With little consensus on what “co-creation” is, we offer a
                  novel, unifying perspective by anchoring its theorization in
                  creation through interactions. We develop a definition of
                  co-creation as enactment of interactional creation across
                  interactive system-environments (afforded by interactive
                  platforms) entailing agencing engagements and structuring
                  organizations. Interactional creation is enacted by means of
                  interactions of “agencial assemblages”, while agencing
                  engagements and structuring organizations enable and constrain
                  interactions. Interactive platforms, i.e., instantiations of
                  agencial assemblages, are composed of heterogeneous relations
                  of artifacts, processes, interfaces, and persons. Aided by
                  digitalized technologies, interactive platforms afford a
                  multiplicity of interactive system-environments that connect
                  creational interactions with how experienced outcomes emerge
                  from their underlying resourced capabilities. We apply our
                  definitional framework to the practice of value creation as a
                  co-creation, cutting across conventional “production”,
                  “exchange”, and “use” activities. In doing so, we introduce
                  the concept of value-in-interactional creation. We conclude by
                  providing a summary of our conceptualization, explanation of
                  terms in definition, and illustration in practice, while
                  emphasizing the main contributions of our framework and its

  abstract     = {AbstractA model of the neuropsychology of anxiety is proposed.
                  The model is based in the first instance upon an analysis of
                  the behavioural effects of the antianxiety drugs
                  (benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and alcohol) in animals. From
                  such psychopharmacologi-cal experiments the concept of a
                  “behavioural inhibition system” (BIS) has been developed. This
                  system responds to novel stimuli or to those associated with
                  punishment or nonreward by inhibiting ongoing behaviour and
                  increasing arousal and attention to the environment. It is
                  activity in the BIS that constitutes anxiety and that is
                  reduced by antianxiety drugs. The effects of the antianxiety
                  drugs in the brain also suggest hypotheses concerning the
                  neural substrate of anxiety. Although the benzodiazepines and
                  barbiturates facilitate the effects of γ-aminobutyrate, this
                  is insufficient to explain their highly specific behavioural
                  effects. Because of similarities between the behavioural
                  effects of certain lesions and those of the antianxiety drugs,
                  it is proposed that these drugs reduce anxiety by impairing
                  the functioning of a widespread neural system including the
                  septo-hippocampal system (SHS), the Papez circuit, the
                  prefrontal cortex, and ascending monoaminergic and cholinergic
                  pathways which innervate these forebrain structures. Analysis
                  of the functions of this system (based on anatomical,
                  physiological, and behavioural data) suggests that it acts as
                  a comparator: it compares predicted to actual sensory events
                  and activates the outputs of the BIS when there is a mismatch
                  or when the predicted event is aversive. Suggestions are made
                  as to the functions of particular pathways within this overall
                  brain system. The resulting theory is applied to the symptoms
                  and treatment of anxiety in man, its relations to depression,
                  and the personality of individuals who are susceptible to
                  anxiety or depression.},

                  demonstrate the application of an algorithm using contextual
                  data to ascertain consumer personality traits; and second to
                  explore the factors impacting the relationship between
                  personality traits and advertisement
                  persuasiveness.Design/methodology/approachA mixed-method
                  approach that comprises two distinct yet complementary
                  studies. The first uses quantitative methods and is based on a
                  sample of 35,264 retail banking customers. Study 2 explores
                  the findings that emerge from Study 1 using qualitative
                  methods.FindingsThis paper finds that matching consumer
                  personality with congruent advertising messages can lead to
                  more effective consumer persuasion for most personality types.
                  For consumers who exhibit neurotic personality traits,
                  ameliorating perceived risks during purchasing and providing
                  cues for social acceptance and goal attainment are important
                  factors for advertising effectiveness. These factors also had
                  a positive impact on the purchasing behaviour of extroverted
                  consumers.Research limitations/implicationsThis research
                  focusses on understanding purchasing behaviour based on the
                  most dominant personality trait. However, people are likely to
                  exhibit a combination of most or even all of the Big Five
                  personality traits.Practical implicationsBuilding on advances
                  in natural language processing, enabling the identification of
                  personality from language, this study demonstrates the
                  possibility of influencing consumer behaviour by matching
                  machine inferred personality to congruent persuasive
                  advertising. It is one of the few studies to use contextual
                  instead of social media data to capture individual
                  personality. Such data serves to capture an authentic rather
                  than contrived persona. Further, the study identifies the
                  factors that may moderate this relationship and thereby
                  provides an explanation of why some personality traits exhibit
                  differences in purchasing behaviour from those that are
                  anticipated by existing theory.Originality/valueAlthough the
                  idea that people are more likely to be responsive to
                  advertising messages that are congruent with their personality
                  type has already been successfully applied by advertising
                  practitioners and documented by advertising scholars, this
                  study extends existing research by identifying the factors
                  that may moderate this relationship and thereby provides an
                  explanation why some personality traits may exhibit
                  differences in purchasing behaviour from those that are
                  anticipated by existing theory.},

                  the transition from human-free to human-dominated ecosystems.
                  Nevertheless, human beings are still treated as exogenous
                  factors in many ecological studies. Human activity can
                  reasonably be assumed to influence many processes and patterns
                  studied in ecology at different spatial and temporal scales.
                  Thus, trying to predict the future of ecosystems while
                  ignoring the influence of human activities is neither
                  realistic nor useful. We argue that a successful integration
                  effort in traditional ecology must result from a theoretical
                  and/or conceptual change. A logical and intuitive theoretical
                  leap should be one that considers human actions in light of an
                  integrative scenario. In the first part of this article, we
                  discuss the need for conceptual, theoretical, and
                  methodological changes in studies focusing on the idea of
                  chronic anthropogenic disturbances. In the second part, we
                  introduce the Niche Construction Theory (NCT) as an
                  integrative scenario accommodating these theoretical and
                  conceptual changes in studies that investigate human actions
                  in the environment. To exemplify our argument, we present a
                  case study resulting from our research and focusing on the
                  cascading effects of human activities and their multilevel and
                  multiscale influences in the landscape.},

                  In this Perspective, we compare and contrast unidimensional
                  versus multidimensional understandings of well-being, and
                  corresponding measures of life satisfaction or life evaluation

                  pragmatic and policy arguments that have been put forward for
                  each of these understandings and measurement approaches. While
                  we argue that well-being needs to be conceptually and
                  scientifically understood, and empirically studied, as a
                  multidimensional construct, we acknowledge the pragmatic and

                  approach leads to efficiency and effectiveness gains in the
                  marketing research process. In qualitative research, they show
                  that LLMs can assist in both data generation and analysis;
                  LLMs effectively create sample characteristics, generate
                  synthetic respondents, and conduct and moderate in-depth
                  interviews. The AI-human hybrid generates information-rich,
                  coherent data that surpasses human-only data in depth and
                  insightfulness and matches human performance in data analysis
                  tasks of generating themes and summaries. Evidence from expert
                  judges shows that humans and LLMs possess complementary
                  skills; the human-LLM hybrid outperforms its human-only or
                  LLM-only counterpart. For quantitative research, the LLM
                  correctly picks the answer direction and valence, with the
                  quality of synthetic data significantly improving through
                  few-shot learning and retrieval-augmented generation. The
                  authors demonstrate the value of the AI-human hybrid by
                  collaborating with a Fortune 500 food company and replicating
                  a 2019 qualitative and quantitative study using GPT-4. For
                  their empirical investigation, the authors design the system
                  architecture and prompts to create personas, ask questions,
                  and obtain responses from synthetic respondents. They provide
                  roadmaps for integrating LLMs into qualitative and
                  quantitative marketing research and conclude that LLMs serve
                  as valuable collaborators in the insight generation process.},

                  Americans, denial of racism internalized via the model
                  minority myth (MMM), and colorism have been found to
                  negatively affect their mental health. Yet, for a growing
                  population of multiracial Asian Americans with diverse and
                  intersecting identities, scant research examines their
                  perceptions of these forms of racism. In the present study,
                  201 multiracial Asian American adults (self-identified with
                  more than one racial background, one of which was of Asian
                  descent) completed online surveys in 2020, in the context of
                  the COVID-19 pandemic surge in anti-Asian racism. Initial
                  hypotheses, examined with bivariate regression analyses, were
                  that higher perceptions of racial microaggressions and darker
                  skin tone would relate to lower internalized MMM beliefs, in
                  its two components of achievement orientation (MMM-AO) and
                  unrestricted mobility (MMM-UM). Based on initial findings, a
                  post hoc hierarchical regression analysis was used to examine
                  the degree to which multiracial Asian Americans’ perceptions
                  of racial microaggressions, beyond endorsement of MMM beliefs,
                  were predicted by two sociodemographic variables, gender
                  identity and racial/ethnic group identity as Asian/White or
                  Asian/dual minority (including one or more other racial/ethnic
                  minority groups). Results did not support hypothesized
                  influences of skin tone, gender identity, or internalized
                  MMM-AO beliefs. However, higher microaggression perceptions
                  were related to lower internalized MMM-UM beliefs (less denial
                  of racism). Also, Asian/dual-minority group identity, compared
                  to Asian/White, was related to higher microaggression
                  perceptions. Possible explanations, limitations, and

                  adversity, are admirable qualities. However, knowing when to
                  stop pursuing something is as important as exerting effort
                  toward attaining a goal. How do people decide when to persist
                  and when to quit? Here, we design a novel task to study this
                  question, in which people were given a finite number of
                  opportunities to pursue stochastic rewards by selecting among
                  a set of options that provide a reward each trial. At any
                  time, if people were not satisfied with the option they had
                  selected they could choose to abandon it and instead try a new
                  option. However, if they did so they could never return to the
                  previous option. Mathematical analysis of this task shows that
                  the optimal strategy explores a relatively small number of
                  options before settling on a sufficiently good option.
                  Further, we find that the optimal strategy is to abandon an
                  option if the total number of remaining trials exceeds a
                  threshold specified by the observed option's performance. A
                  large-scale, preregistered experiment (N = 3,632) reveals that
                  people largely behave in accordance with the optimal strategy.
                  People also make decisions to persist with an option based on
                  its performance, and they typically explore relatively few
                  options before settling on a sufficiently good one. However,
                  compared with the optimal strategy, people are less sensitive
                  to the number of remaining trials and are more likely to
                  persist with suboptimal options. (PsycInfo Database Record (c)

                  cognitive job resources, thereby increasing creativity. Our
                  hypotheses were supported by a field experiment, in which we
                  randomly assigned employees in a technology consulting firm to

                  and associations. Recent evidence indicates that the
                  imposition of constraints can facilitate the creative quality
                  of ideas compared to conditions that are more open-ended.
                  However, are controlled cognitive processes required when
                  generating ideas under constraints, or can constraints
                  stimulate creative responses through associative mechanisms?
                  This current study extends prior work on constraints and
                  creativity by manipulating the presence of thematic
                  constraints in the alternate uses task, while also
                  manipulating cognitive load to address this question. The
                  primary measures were the novelty and usefulness of ideas. The
                  results indicate that constraints increased the novelty of
                  ideas, and this effect was not impacted by the presence of
                  load. Participants also reported relying less on a
                  memory-based approach in the high-constraint condition.
                  However, under high constraint and high load, the usefulness
                  of ideas was somewhat reduced. These findings suggest that
                  thematic constraints can facilitate idea novelty through
                  associational mechanisms that do not strongly depend on
                  controlled processing resources. However, meaningfully
                  combining the constraint and the object in a manner that
                  results in ideas that are both novel and useful may depend
                  more on the availability of such resources. (PsycInfo Database

                  their favorite products, they often opt for products from
                  different categories, demonstrating variety‐seeking behavior.
                  This study focuses on consumers' variety‐seeking behavior,
                  employing theories related to attachment to explore the
                  mechanisms by which stress affects this behavior. It
                  specifically examines how stress influences the
                  variety‐seeking preferences of individuals with different
                  levels of secure attachment. The research was conducted in two
                  parts: the first using surveys and the second using
                  experimental methods. The results indicate that individuals
                  with low levels of secure attachment experience heightened
                  feelings of insecurity under stress, leading to increased
                  familiarity seeking and, consequently, reduced variety‐seeking
                  in consumption. Conversely, individuals with high levels of
                  secure attachment are likely to reduce their risk‐taking
                  behaviors under stress, also increasing familiarity‐seeking
                  and reducing variety‐seeking consumption. These findings
                  illustrate how consumers with different levels of secure
                  attachment alter their variety‐seeking behavior in stressful
                  situations and enrich the body of research on consumers'
                  variety‐seeking under stress.},

                  time varies by couples’ employment and parental status. We use
                  two alternative measures of unpaid work, which differ in

                  activity. Contrasting sharply with the image painted by
                  Hochschild (1989), when we combine all types of families, we
                  find little gender gap in total work hours (paid plus unpaid),
                  whether or not secondary activities are included. However, the

                  have preschool-age children and both men and women are

                  activities is included). Women’s excess total work is even
                  higher in unconventional families where men are not employed
                  full-time. On the other hand, where women are not employed and
                  men are, men work substantially more total (paid plus unpaid)
                  hours than women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all

                  decision‐making styles in attaining various real‐life
                  outcomes, it has neglected to explore the underlying
                  goal‐related processes in terms of goal dimensions (ways in
                  which people appraise their goals during goal striving). The
                  present study examines whether the most studied
                  decision‐making styles are related to self‐reported effort,
                  goal progress, and action crisis as well as other goal
                  dimensions. We conducted 14 studies (mutual conceptual
                  replications) with Ntotal = 2574 (70\% females) which included
                  the General Decision‐Making Styles questionnaire and various
                  goal‐related scales. The results from the mini meta‐analysis
                  showed that the rational and intuitive styles were positively
                  related to the goal dimensions associated with successful goal
                  pursuit (e.g., goal commitment, goal attainability, positive
                  emotions, and goal progress), while the avoidant style was
                  mainly related to various difficulties associated with goal
                  striving (e.g., controlled motivation, negative emotions, and
                  action crisis). The dependent and especially spontaneous
                  styles were found to be very weakly associated with the
                  selected goal dimensions. When the separate studies were
                  analyzed in the regression analyses and more process‐oriented
                  goal dimensions were accounted for, decision‐making styles
                  were only minor predictors of self‐reported effort
                  expenditure, goal progress and action crisis. The study
                  highlights the need and usefulness of a more nuanced
                  processual approach in the research of individual
                  decision‐making differences in goal‐directed behavior.},

                  implications for happiness and well‐being. Extant research on
                  time in the consumer behavior literature reveals a
                  predominantly dichotomized perspective of time between the
                  present and future. Drawing on research on emotions, social
                  relationships, and financial decision‐making, we discuss how
                  removing categorical dichotomies might lead to beneficial
                  outcomes. From this, we propose a conceptualization of time
                  that assumes a less stark contrast between the present and the
                  future, allowing these two time frames to more flexibly
                  coexist in people's minds and experiences. Finally, we discuss
                  one way people might adopt this perspective to increase
                  happiness—by taking an elevated or “bird's‐eye” perspective of
                  time where the future and present, as well as the past, become
                  equally visible, and where events from different time points

                  presence of inattentive survey participants and non-human
                  respondents (bots). We compared the quality of the data
                  collected through five commonly used platforms. Data quality
                  was indicated by the percentage of participants who
                  meaningfully respond to the researcher's question (high
                  quality) versus those who only contribute noise (low quality).
                  We found that compared to MTurk, Qualtrics, or an
                  undergraduate student sample (i.e., SONA), participants on
                  Prolific and CloudResearch were more likely to pass various

                  communication channels. In this context, consumers are
                  increasingly gathering in online communities which have been
                  identified as social-media-based brand communities (SMBBCs).
                  However, notwithstanding scholars' attention towards SMBBCs,
                  the role of consumers' gender in developing brand loyalty
                  intention (BLI) has been scarcely explored by literature.
                  Moreover, scant attention has been given to the analysis of
                  whether gender is related to different propensities towards
                  brand recommendation—identified as a proactive behavior
                  towards a positive electronic word of-mouth diffusion
                  (E-WOM)—in the social media context. Hence, this research aims
                  to explore the antecedents of BLI and E-WOM by focusing on
                  consumers' gender differences. A structural equation model has
                  been created based on 250 surveys collected among SMBBCs of an
                  American sportswear brand. The results showed that male
                  consumers' BLI is influenced by engagement in SMBBCs. Instead,
                  brand trust was the main antecedent of females' BLI.},

                  satisfy a need for stimulation. It is suggested that consumers
                  may try to achieve an optimal level of stimulation by
                  balancing the stimulation sought from product choice with the
                  stimulation available from the choice context. Two laboratory
                  experiments are conducted that show that causing changes in
                  the choice context (thus increasing stimulation) decreases the
                  amount of variety seeking subjects exhibit in product choices.
                  Specifically, the results of the experiments suggest that
                  consumers' needs for stimulation may be met by providing
                  variety in a different product category or in other aspects of
                  the choice context. A limiting condition to this finding is
                  also examined. If positive affect is induced along with
                  stimulation, then the reduction in variety-seeking behavior is
                  mitigated. Copyright 1995 by the University of Chicago.},

                  aspects interact in regard to the concept of social reputation
                  and our private versus social selves, which appear to be
                  essentially intervening, and potentially conflicting, factors
                  driving choice? In our study, we investigated liking and
                  willingness-to-pay choices using-in art research-a novel,
                  forced-choice paradigm. Participants (N = 123) made choices
                  from artwork-triplets presented with opposing artistic quality
                  and monetary value-labeling, thereby creating ambiguous choice
                  situations. Choices were made in either private or in
                  social/public contexts, in which participants were made to
                  believe that either art-pricing or art-making experts were
                  watching their selections. A multi-method design with
                  eye-tracking, neuroendocrinology (testosterone, cortisol), and
                  motivational factors complemented the behavioral choice
                  analysis. Results showed that artworks, of which participants
                  were told were of high artistic value were more often liked
                  and those of high monetary-value received more
                  willingness-to-pay choices. However, while willingness-to-pay
                  was significantly affected by the presumed observation of
                  art-pricing experts, liking selections did not differ between
                  private/public contexts. Liking choices, compared to
                  willingness-to-pay, were also better predicted by eye movement
                  patterns. Whereas, hormone levels had a stronger relation with
                  monetary aspects (willingness-to-pay/ art-pricing expert).
                  This was further confirmed by motivational factors
                  representative for reputation seeking behavior. Our study
                  points to an unexplored terrain highlighting the linkage of
                  social reputation mechanisms and its impact on choice behavior
                  with a ubiquitous commodity, art.},

                  restore fairness. However, the effectiveness of this strategy
                  remains unclear. Using an ecological environment where
                  excessive criticism is rampant—Major League Baseball—we assess
                  the impact of verbal aggression on subsequent home-plate
                  umpire decision making during the 2010 to 2019 seasons ( N =
                  153,255 pitches). Results suggest a two-sided benefit of
                  resorting to verbal abuse. After being excessively criticized,
                  home-plate umpires ( N = 110 adults, employed in the United
                  States) were less likely to call strikes to batters from the
                  complaining team and more prone to call strikes to batters on
                  the opposing team. A series of additional analyses lead us to
                  reject an alternative hypothesis, namely that umpires, after
                  ejecting the aggressor, seek to compensate for the negative
                  consequences brought on by the loss of a teammate. Rather, our
                  findings support the hypothesis that, under certain

                  in the era of streaming cinema. It starts from the assumption
                  that because of the different institutional logic at work in
                  the land of SVODs, the affordances that recycled content
                  brings may not be as effective (and necessary) as it has been
                  in Hollywood. Using a database-centered approach, we analyze
                  658 Netflix Original films. Between 2015 and 2022, Netflix
                  released 440 non-recycled Originals, showcasing a commitment
                  to offering a high quantity of niche films. The dataset
                  equally shows that the percentage of recycled films (33\%)
                  follow a linear upward pattern, highlighting the persistence
                  of conservative content strategies. More specifically,
                  (re-)adaptations constituted the biggest chunk of recycled
                  content (68\%), as these allow the streamer to quickly fill
                  its catalog with recyclable IP. Netflix’s inclination toward
                  sequels (16\%), spin-offs (6\%), and prequels (2\%) aligns
                  with its sequelization strategy, while also leveraging its own
                  IP. Remakes (8\%) play a less significant role, likely due to
                  the relatively young age of Netflix’s content library. The
                  article concludes that Netflix may, in fact, be less of a
                  disruptive force to the film industry in terms of the
                  diversity of its content creation, prompting further recycling
                  of existing properties.},

                  at some point in their lives implies that it serves an
                  adaptive function. Building on biological theories of herding
                  in animals, according to which collective movement emerges
                  from local interactions that are based on principles of
                  attraction, repulsion and alignment, we propose an approach
                  that synthesizes these principles with theories of loneliness
                  in humans. We present here the ‘herding model of loneliness’
                  that extends these principles into the psychological domain.
                  We hold that these principles serve as basic building blocks
                  of human interactions and propose that distorted attraction
                  and repulsion tendencies may lead to inability to align
                  properly with others, which may be a core component in
                  loneliness emergence and perpetuation. We describe a neural
                  model of herding in humans and suggest that loneliness may be
                  associated with altered interactions between the gap/error
                  detection, reward signaling, threat and observation-execution
                  systems. The proposed model offers a framework to predict the
                  behavior of lonely individuals and thus may inform

                  articles and social media users claimed that the library (or
                  ‘stock’) music heard in the videos consisted of so-called
                  ‘soundalikes’, and questioned whether this choice was a public
                  endorsement of problematic individuals or groups connected
                  with the tracks in question: namely, conspiracy-theory
                  movement QAnon, and convicted rock singer Gary Glitter. This
                  article explores how library music is used strategically in
                  these videos, highlighting the urgency of inquiring into its
                  fundamental role in the construction and dissemination of

                  to its use in politically motivated videos. This allows us to
                  rethink longstanding notions of library music as something
                  that lacks a public existence, and to focus instead on what
                  happens when it gains media coverage – prompting
                  misunderstandings that reveal how unfamiliar the wider public

                  answer this question, we exploit product-level variation in
                  sales and prices of over 4 million products, observed weekly
                  between 2014 and 2017 for the entire French market. A unique
                  feature of our data is that we observe sales for both physical
                  and digital products, as well as streaming consumption. At the
                  track-level, we find that streaming displaces digital sales.
                  At the more aggregate artist-level, digital sales displace
                  physical sales, but streaming implies a promotional effect on
                  physical sales. This complementarity is driven by popular
                  genres, i.e., Pop and Variety. Most of our findings are robust

                  better understand the motivations behind these two types of
                  trolling. Study 1 surveyed participants who had engaged in
                  trolling ( N = 90) and identified four motivations for online
                  trolling through an inductive qualitative analysis: revenge,
                  maintaining social justice, rebutting for disagreement, and
                  thrill-seeking. Study 2 developed scales to measure the four
                  trolling motivations and validated them through another survey
                  of participants who had engaged in trolling ( N = 455). The
                  quantitative results supported the four-factor motivation of
                  trolling and the proactive–reactive trolling scale. Structural
                  equation modeling revealed that thrill-seeking and rebutting

  abstract     = {In the wake of inflation, investors engage in identifying
                  inflation hedging instruments. Most importantly, investors
                  attempt to minimize risk and maximize returns to safeguard
                  against inflation. Risk plays an important role in this
                  process. The objective of this research is to examine the
                  relationship between risk factors and investor behavior,
                  particularly in the Indian context. Based on the theory of
                  planned behavior (TPB), we built a conceptual model
                  investigating the intricate relationship between risk factors,
                  investment priority, investment strategy and investment
                  decision-making. We collected data from 537 respondents in the
                  southern region of India and analyzed the data using Partial
                  Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The
                  result indicate: (i) risk factors (risk capacity, risk
                  tolerance, and risk propensity) are positively related to
                  investment priority and investment strategy, (ii) investment
                  priority is positively related to investment decision-making,
                  (iii) conscientiousness moderates the relationship between
                  investment priority and investment decision-making, (iv)
                  investment strategy is positively related to investment
                  decision-making. Finally, the practical and theoretical
                  implications for research are discussed.},

                  rejection” threatens belongingness more than “competence
                  rejection,” whereas competence rejection threatens sense of
                  efficacy more than warmth rejection. To restore threatened
                  belongingness, warmth (vs. competence) rejection was predicted
                  to result in higher affiliative responses. In contrast, to
                  restore the threatened sense of efficacy, competence (vs.
                  warmth) rejection would lead to higher self-focus. Across six
                  studies, we found that the participants exhibited more
                  affiliative responses after being rejected due to low warmth
                  than due to low competence (Studies 1–6), whereas they became
                  more self-focused after being rejected due to low competence
                  than due to low warmth (Studies 3–6). Furthermore, the effect
                  of warmth rejection on affiliation was mediated by perceived
                  threat to belongingness (Studies 4–6), whereas the effect of
                  competence rejection on self-focus was mediated by perceived
                  threat to control and belongingness (Studies 4–6). The studies
                  provided converging evidence that the effects of social
                  rejection depend on the perception of why rejection occurs.

                  ethnic minority participants), 6 focus groups, and 10
                  semi-structured interviews (with ethnic minority travelers)
                  were conducted in the UK. The findings reveal the existence of

                  during international and domestic travel, with ethnicity being
                  a key factor. The paper identifies the need to adopt a

                  reach for people because their computational resources are
                  limited. Instead, people may rely on computationally frugal
                  heuristics that usually yield good outcomes. Although previous
                  research has identified many such heuristics, discovering good
                  heuristics and predicting when they will be used remains
                  challenging. Here, we present a theoretical framework that
                  allows us to use methods from machine learning to
                  automatically derive the best heuristic to use in any given
                  situation by considering how to make the best use of limited
                  cognitive resources. To demonstrate the generalizability and
                  accuracy of our method, we compare the heuristics it discovers
                  against those used by people across a wide range of
                  multi-attribute risky choice environments in a behavioral
                  experiment that is an order of magnitude larger than any
                  previous experiments of its type. Our method rediscovered
                  known heuristics, identifying them as rational strategies for
                  specific environments, and discovered novel heuristics that
                  had been previously overlooked. Our results show that people
                  adapt their decision strategies to the structure of the
                  environment and generally make good use of their limited
                  cognitive resources, although their strategy choices do not
                  always fully exploit the structure of the environment.

                  development of scientific knowledge in consumer research by
                  summarizing the findings of 222 meta-analyses that together
                  include 2481 meta-analytic effect sizes. The results provide
                  an overview of how much we know and how knowledge has
                  developed in consumer research over time. By explaining 7.8\%
                  variance (r = 0.28) in consumer-relevant dependent variables,
                  the findings show that consumer research, a comparatively
                  young discipline, is relatively effective at knowledge
                  development compared to other disciplines. Furthermore, the
                  accumulation of knowledge is significantly increasing,
                  suggesting that our discipline is still in the growing phase
                  of its life cycle and generating continuously improving
                  explanations of consumer-related phenomena. The development of
                  knowledge varies across consumer-relevant dependent variables,
                  with strong explanations for relationships but significantly
                  weaker ones for memory, affect, and attitudes. Moreover, the
                  knowledge synthesized in meta-analyses is fairly—though not
                  fully—representative of the content of primary research on

                  Screening, data extraction, coding, and risk of bias

                  Bayesian arm based, multilevel network meta-analyses were

                  for each arm was graded using the confidence in network
                  meta-analysis (CINeMA) online tool. Data sources Cochrane
                  Library, Medline, Embase, SPORTDiscus, and PsycINFO databases.
                  Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Any randomised
                  trial with exercise arms for participants meeting clinical
                  cut-offs for major depression. Results 218 unique studies with
                  a total of 495 arms and 14 170 participants were included.
                  Compared with active controls (eg, usual care, placebo
                  tablet), moderate reductions in depression were found for
                  walking or jogging (n=1210, κ=51, Hedges’ g −0.62, 95\%
                  credible interval −0.80 to −0.45), yoga (n=1047, κ=33, g
                  −0.55, −0.73 to −0.36), strength training (n=643, κ=22, g
                  −0.49, −0.69 to −0.29), mixed aerobic exercises (n=1286, κ=51,
                  g −0.43, −0.61 to −0.24), and tai chi or qigong (n=343, κ=12,
                  g −0.42, −0.65 to −0.21). The effects of exercise were
                  proportional to the intensity prescribed. Strength training
                  and yoga appeared to be the most acceptable modalities.
                  Results appeared robust to publication bias, but only one
                  study met the Cochrane criteria for low risk of bias. As a
                  result, confidence in accordance with CINeMA was low for
                  walking or jogging and very low for other treatments.
                  Conclusions Exercise is an effective treatment for depression,
                  with walking or jogging, yoga, and strength training more
                  effective than other exercises, particularly when intense.
                  Yoga and strength training were well tolerated compared with
                  other treatments. Exercise appeared equally effective for
                  people with and without comorbidities and with different
                  baseline levels of depression. To mitigate expectancy effects,
                  future studies could aim to blind participants and staff.
                  These forms of exercise could be considered alongside
                  psychotherapy and antidepressants as core treatments for
                  depression. Systematic review registration PROSPERO

                  attitudes through religiosity and the perception of the target
                  group's mindset. Study 1 demonstrates that belief in God is
                  associated with uncertainty avoidance and increases prejudice
                  against value-violating groups, but simultaneously increases
                  positive attitudes towards value-consistent groups. Study 2

                  intergroup attitudes when the relationship is mediated through
                  the belief in God and the perception that a target group

                  and to produce desired results is essential for an

                  perception of control is not only desirable, but is also
                  probably a psychological and biological necessity. In this

                  control over the environment. Converging evidence from animal
                  research, clinical studies and neuroimaging suggests that the
                  need for control is a biological imperative for survival, and
                  a corticostriatal network is implicated as the neural

                  (M = 20.20, SD = 3.91). This instrument was designed to
                  measure 2 facets of intolerance of uncertainty-prospective
                  anxiety and inhibitory anxiety-although total scores on the

                  determine the degree to which derivation of total versus
                  subscale scores is empirically permissible. Comparison of a

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate the
                  prognostic value of quadriceps isometric strength (QIS) in
                  coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: The study population
                  consisted of 1314 patients aged >30 years (64.7 ± 10.6 years,
                  1051 male) with CAD who were hospitalized for acute coronary
                  syndrome or coronary artery bypass grafting. Maximal QIS was
                  evaluated as a marker of leg strength and expressed relative
                  to body weight (\% body weight). The primary and secondary
                  endpoints were all-cause death and cardiovascular (CV) death,
                  respectively. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 5.0 ± 3.5
                  years, corresponding to 6537 person-years, there were 118
                  all-cause deaths and 63 CV deaths. A higher QIS remained
                  associated with decreased all-cause mortality and CV mortality
                  risks (hazard ratio for increasing 10\% body weight of QIS
                  0.77, 95\% confidence interval 0.67-0.89, P < .001 for
                  all-cause death; hazard ratio 0.66, 95\% confidence interval
                  0.54-0.82, P < .001 for CV death) after adjustment for other
                  prognostic factors. The inclusion of QIS significantly
                  increased both continuous net reclassification improvement
                  (cNRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) for
                  all-cause death (cNRI: 0.25, P = .009; IDI: 0.007, P = .030)
                  and CV death (cNRI: 0.34, P = .008; IDI: 0.013, P = .008).
                  CONCLUSIONS: A high level of quadriceps strength was strongly
                  associated with a lower risk of both all-cause and CV
                  mortality in patients with CAD. Evaluation of QIS offered
                  incremental prognostic information beyond pre-existing risk
                  factors.},

                  policies effectively increase classroom attendance and subject
                  mastery. First, in a randomized controlled field study, we
                  explored the effect of allowing students to choose whether to
                  make their attendance mandatory (i.e., a component of their
                  course grades). We found that nearly all students used the
                  opportunity as a pre-commitment device and were subsequently
                  more likely to attend class than were students whose
                  attendance had been mandated. Second, in a multi-year cohort
                  study, we explored the effect of allowing students to opt out
                  of a challenging, high-effort assessment stream, finding that
                  students given greater autonomy invested more effort into

                  pandemic, where people compensated for social isolation by

                  further explore this effect and its underlying mechanism, the
                  authors tested the hypothesis that reduced social contact
                  during lockdown conditions would lead people to feel lonely
                  and bored and, in turn, increase their consumption of
                  nostalgic music. Study 1 ( Nsong = 213,464) established the
                  temporal relationships between social contact and nostalgia by
                  analyzing mobility data and daily listening patterns of top
                  songs on the music platform Spotify from 2019 to 2021. Study 2

                  consumption of nostalgic songs through loneliness, but not
                  boredom. These findings shed light on the use of nostalgia as

  abstract     = {Abstract Products often aim to help consumers achieve desired
                  outcomes such as increasing energy levels or removing fabric
                  stains. These products typically work via rich causal paths.
                  The current research suggests that the structure of these
                  paths influences consumer judgments of product efficacy. In
                  particular, sequential steps in these paths can evoke distinct
                  directionalities—either increasing or decreasing variables in
                  each step along the way. For example, a face cream could be
                  described as “increasing the turnover of skin cells to reduce
                  wrinkles.” Under our framework, the action influencing skin
                  cells would correspond to increasing directionality, while the
                  action influencing wrinkles would correspond to decreasing
                  directionality. Ten experiments provide evidence that
                  consumers prefer products with directionally consistent causal
                  chains (ie, all steps evoking the same directionality) over
                  those with directionally inconsistent ones (ie, steps evoking
                  contrasting directionalities). This occurs because consumers
                  find directionally consistent causal chains easier to process
                  which in turn leads them to infer higher efficacy from
                  products working via such consistent chains. These findings
                  advance our understanding of how consumers evaluate product
                  descriptions and provide prescriptions for marketers tasked
                  with composing product descriptions to convey efficacy.},

                  It is a key component of worry, state anxiety, and related
                  anxiety pathologies. The 27-item Intolerance of Uncertainty
                  Scale (IUS) was developed to measure intolerance of
                  uncertainty. Previous psychometric analyses of the IUS have
                  suggested both four- and five-factor models. High inter-item
                  correlations, factor instability, and previous theoretical
                  research support the development of a reduced measure. The
                  present study used two undergraduate samples and evaluated a
                  psychometrically stable 12-item two-factor version of the IUS.
                  The reduced measure (IUS-12) retained exemplary internal
                  consistency, while correlating extremely well with the
                  original IUS and related measures of anxiety and worry. The
                  IUS-12 also demonstrated a stable two-factor structure,
                  representing both anxious and avoidance components of
                  intolerance of uncertainty. Directions for future research and

                  people strongly dislike risk. We challenge this proposition
                  across seven studies. Though people seem to irrationally
                  dislike risky prospects when preference is assessed with
                  open-ended pricing measures, such as willingness-to-pay,
                  people display rational responses toward risky prospects when
                  preference is assessed using rating measures, such as ratings
                  of expected enjoyment. This discrepancy does not seem to arise
                  because these measures (a) focus on different components of
                  the uncertainty, (b) rely on context-dependent versus normed
                  scales, or (c) involve voluntarily opting into an uncertain
                  situation. Accordingly, we find that people also display
                  rational responses toward risky prospects with time measures
                  (i.e., willingness-to-wait and anticipated time usage) and
                  choice. We discuss alternative explanations and crucial

                  individuals see themselves. In four studies (N=945) using
                  person-perception, longitudinal, and experimental designs, we
                  demonstrate that feeling understood changes individuals'
                  self-concept by increasing the centrality of a specific
                  relationship (relationship identification). Study 1 showed
                  that participants perceived an individual to be more
                  identified with their relationship when their partner was high
                  (vs. low) in understanding. Study 2 extended these results by
                  examining individuals in romantic relationships
                  longitudinally. The results of Studies 1 and 2 were distinct
                  for understanding compared to acceptance and caring. Studies 3
                  and 4 manipulated felt understanding. Recalling many versus
                  few understanding instances (Study 3) and imagining a close
                  other being low versus high in understanding (Study 4) led
                  individuals to feel less understood, which reduced
                  identification in their friendships and romantic
                  relationships. Furthermore, Study 4 suggests that coherence

                  how a firm's degree of business model development—the extent

                  impact of a scientific approach to decision‐making on
                  performance. We present findings from a field experiment
                  involving 261 entrepreneurs, where treated entrepreneurs learn
                  to apply a scientific approach, while control counterparts
                  receive comparable content without this approach. Results show
                  that the effect of scientific decision making varies with
                  business model development. Treated entrepreneurs with higher
                  degrees of business model development elaborated their
                  theories of value focusing on lower‐level choices, achieving
                  superior economic performance compared to controls.
                  Conversely, treated entrepreneurs with lower levels of
                  business model development reevaluated fundamental aspects,
                  resulting in increased epistemic uncertainty and less

                  entrepreneurs, we explored how the degree of business strategy
                  definition influences the benefits of adopting a scientific
                  approach to decision‐making. In the experiment, half of the
                  entrepreneurs were taught to use a scientific approach for
                  making decisions (the treated group), while the others
                  received similar training without the scientific approach (the
                  control group). Results show that treated entrepreneurs with
                  already defined strategies benefited more, experiencing
                  improved performance even in the short term. Conversely,
                  treated entrepreneurs with strategies still under definition
                  experienced more uncertainty and lower short‐term economic
                  performance, as the scientific approach prompted them to
                  reassess and adjust their core strategic decisions.},

                  recognizing that others have brought benefits into one's life.
                  Loneliness, on the other hand, is an unpleasant emotion
                  resulting from a perceived lack of social connectedness.
                  Although previous studies have reported an inverse association
                  between gratitude and loneliness, these studies have not been
                  systematically examined in a single review. To address this
                  gap in the literature, we conducted a random-effects
                  meta-analysis to examine the association between gratitude and
                  loneliness. Analysis of 26 studies revealed a moderate sized
                  effect (mean Fisher's z transformed correlation, zr = -.406,
                  95\% confidence interval [CI] = -.463, -.349; mean
                  back-transformed correlation, r = -.385, 95\% CI = -.433,
                  -.335). To complement these effect sizes, we calculated a
                  probability-based common language effect size for
                  correlations. Random-effects homogeneity testing suggested the
                  presence of effect size heterogeneity. Analyses of both
                  continuous and categorical moderators were non-significant,
                  indicating that these variables did not influence effect size
                  magnitude. Furthermore, publication bias tests suggested that
                  our results were not influenced by unpublished studies.
                  Finally, we proposed several statistical and clinical
                  recommendations for future research. Regarding the latter, we
                  offered suggestions for modifying gratitude enhancement
                  programs with the aim of reducing loneliness.},

                  other disciplines, marketing publishes little conceptual
                  research. This paper provides a multidisciplinary perspective
                  of conceptual research to help increase the quality and
                  quantity of conceptual research in marketing. First, the
                  authors compare conceptual research approaches across
                  marketing, management, psychology, and sociology to provide a
                  synthesis of existing conceptual research frameworks. Second,
                  using citation analyses, the authors provide insights into the
                  academic impact of conceptual research across disciplines,
                  across marketing domains, and over time; they also assess its
                  impact outside of academia. Third, to assist researchers, the
                  paper offers a step-by-step process or “how to” guide for
                  developing high-impact conceptual research, based on insights
                  from the multidisciplinary analysis and interviews with
                  conceptual researchers from different disciplines. Fourth,
                  drawing on the interviews and keyword analysis of recent
                  conceptual marketing articles, the authors suggest emerging
                  opportunities for conceptual research and how to increase the
                  value of conceptual papers for practitioners.},

  abstract     = {Nostalgia was once considered a medical disease but is now
                  understood as a beneficial, identity-affirming emotion. Yet
                  what induces feelings of nostalgia is not fully understood.
                  Are nostalgic feelings prompted by changes in a person’s life,
                  and do certain events prompt nostalgia across whole
                  populations? In this paper, we analyze when people listen to
                  nostalgic music. We use data from a large, cross-national
                  survey to train a classifier to detect which tracks are
                  nostalgic for individual listeners. We then analyze a
                  comprehensive dataset of listening histories from a 5.5 year
                  period. Despite it being a complex concept, we were able to
                  predict nostalgic listening with relatively high precision. We
                  compare our results across listeners from four countries to
                  understand how consistent behavior toward nostalgic music is.
                  We find people listen to nostalgic music more often as they
                  age. We also find people tend to listen to nostalgic music
                  consistently in their day-to-day lives. We do not find
                  evidence that listening to personally nostalgic music
                  increases in response to particular traditions, seasons, or
                  events. However, we do find traditions and events can affect
                  how much “back catalog” music people listen to. These trends
                  are consistent across the national contexts we studied. Our
                  results advance prior findings about nostalgia and the life
                  course, and demonstrate a novel methodological consideration
                  for studies of nostalgic listening.},

                  participant in work teams, this study explores how team trust
                  emerges in human–AI teams compared to human–human teams.
                  Adopting a multi‐level approach, we conducted two experimental
                  studies (NStudy1 = 247 two‐member teams and NStudy2 = 106
                  three‐member teams, 828 individuals overall) and investigated
                  how team composition (with AI or human team members) impacts
                  interpersonal trust (affective and cognitive) and thus team
                  trust. In two‐member teams, interpersonal trust via perceived
                  trustworthiness and not via perceived similarity was lower in
                  human–AI teams compared to human–human teams. Exploratory
                  findings showed that team identification and cognitive
                  interpersonal trust were also lower in two‐member human–AI
                  teams than in human–human teams. However, in three‐member
                  teams, we found no differences in team trust via interpersonal
                  trust between the two team types. Instead, our findings
                  revealed that perceived trustworthiness and perceived
                  similarity increased interpersonal trust and, in turn, team
                  trust for both team types. With this research, we showed that
                  underlying theories and evidence of team trust in human‐only
                  teams can enhance understanding of human–AI teams, though the
                  results indicated certain differences that call for further
                  investigation.},

                  single‐others. We attribute this effect to the perceived

                  when others are perceived as particularly unique, the

  abstract     = {AbstractMuch marketing research focuses on what individual
                  consumers need or want for consumption and how they satisfy
                  these needs or wants themselves. However, consumers often give
                  up money, time, or preferences to help others address their
                  consumption needs and wants across the customer journey. The
                  authors introduce the unifying construct of “consumption
                  sacrifice,” defined as the willing and intentional act of
                  incurring a cost to the self—in money, time, or
                  preferences—when making a consumption decision, with expected
                  direct benefits to one's partner. The authors offer examples
                  of consumption sacrifices along the customer journey and
                  suggest that this construct offers a new lens through which to
                  examine the existing literature on choices involving others.
                  The authors put forward the view that sacrifices are often
                  invisible to recipients—and thus underrecognized and
                  underappreciated—failing to achieve their full potential. At
                  the same time, different sacrifice motives (partner‐focused,
                  relationship‐focused, self‐focused) may affect the extent to
                  which actors care about making sacrifices visible to
                  recipients. Finally, the authors propose future research
                  questions, including what leads consumers to perform more
                  visible sacrifices, what drives the invisibility of sacrifices
                  among recipients, and what are the consequences of performing
                  and receiving invisible sacrifices.},

                  Here, we review evidence on the relationship between anxiety—a
                  future-oriented emotion characterized by negative valence,
                  high arousal, and uncertainty—and mentalizing—the ascription
                  of mental content to other agents. We examine three aspects of
                  this relationship: how people with anxiety disorders perform
                  on mentalizing tasks relative to controls; how situational
                  anxiety alters mentalizing performance; and how autistic
                  people, who experience the impacts of mentalizing differences,
                  are at high risk of anxiety. We propose a bidirectional model
                  for understanding how short-term and longer term anxiety are
                  related to mentalizing. Key to this relationship is the
                  aversive experience of uncertainty and the motivations that
                  result from it.},

                  including the call for clothing to be modeled in larger sizes.
                  This call has prompted brands to decide how to model their
                  clothing, in particular, on category pages (i.e., webpages
                  where consumers compare different items). Should brands use
                  varied model sizing, where clothing is presented using models
                  of various sizes? Or should brands use traditionally thin
                  models who are the same nonvaried model size? This research
                  explores female consumers' responses to varied model sizing.
                  Across five studies, we demonstrate a model‐sizing dilemma
                  where female consumers rate impressions of brand values higher
                  but rate shopping ease lower when brands use varied rather
                  than nonvaried model sizing. We show the decrease in shopping
                  ease is driven by lower perceptions of organization during the
                  shopping experience. Importantly, we find that this dilemma
                  can be mitigated by displaying varied model sizing in a more
                  organized manner using hover and filter features.},

                  diagnosis, decision makers typically gather, analyze, and
                  synthesize (integrate) information. In a previous study, we
                  showed that delegating such complex decisions to collaborating
                  pairs increases decision quality substantially compared to
                  that of individuals, without requiring different information
                  gathering. Given the higher costs associated with teamwork,
                  however, it is of great practical interest to understand when
                  in the process the performance benefits of teams may arise, so
                  that particular subtasks can be delegated to teams when most
                  appropriate. We thus conducted an experimental study in which
                  fourth‐year medical students (n = 109) worked either in pairs
                  or alone on two separate subtasks of the diagnostic process:
                  (1) analyzing diagnostic test results (e.g., X‐rays) and (2)
                  integrating previously interpreted test results into
                  diagnoses. Linear mixed‐effects models revealed a small
                  benefit of collaborating pairs over individuals in both
                  subtasks. We conclude that collaborating with a peer may pay
                  off both when analyzing information and when integrating it
                  into a diagnosis as it provides the opportunity to correct
                  each other's errors and to make use of a greater knowledge
                  base. These findings encourage the strategic use of
                  collaboration with a colleague when making complex decisions.

  abstract     = {AbstractBased on the curiosity‐as‐drive theory and the theory
                  of information gaps, we argue that curiosity—that is, the
                  desire to seek out novel information for its own sake—is
                  highly transient, and while people may be tempted by immediate
                  answers, they may be less motivated when they need to wait for
                  information. Contrary to standard economic models, we predict
                  an immediacy effect (or present bias) for information even in
                  those cases when waiting does not affect the objective value
                  of information. Furthermore, we argue that this immediacy
                  effect is independent from motivated emotion‐management; that
                  is, introducing delays makes people less willing to obtain
                  information for its own sake even when information does not
                  elicit strong anticipatory feelings. We test these hypotheses
                  in two pre‐registered experiments (N = 2406) featuring real
                  effort and monetary incentives and find that introducing a
                  delay in information provision significantly reduces
                  participants' willingness to obtain information. In Study 1,
                  we also show that people display a stronger immediacy effect
                  for information than for monetary rewards. In Study 2, we
                  demonstrate that people are impatient for information
                  regardless of how they expect to feel after receiving the
                  information, and even when the perceived instrumental value of
                  information remains unaffected by the delay. The strong
                  impatience for information in both studies is consistent with
                  the notion that curiosity acts as a drive, and as such, is
                  highly transient.},

                  critical gap in explicating the function of nostalgia among
                  people engaged in unhealthy behaviour. In the current
                  systematic review and narrative analysis, we sought to answer
                  whether and under what conditions emotion serves to help or
                  hinder people engaged in unhealthy behaviours in terms of
                  taking action to change. We identified 14 studies and
                  categorized them into two themes. In Theme I, nostalgising
                  about a time in one's life when one was healthier motivated
                  both readiness to change and action to change unhealthy
                  behaviour. In Theme II, nostalgizing about the perceived
                  benefits of engaging in unhealthy behaviour (e.g. social
                  connectedness related to drinking) was associated with the
                  continuance or acceleration of the unhealthy behaviour. This
                  review highlights not only the presence of a link between
                  nostalgia and unhealthy behaviour but also that the content of
                  one's nostalgising matters for understanding whether the

                  Italy, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands regarding music
                  streaming platforms. Through critical analysis, the study
                  investigates both the subjective and objective aspects of
                  their listening experience, as well as their interpretation of
                  algorithmic mediation and platform affordances. The findings

               economic analysis of the F1 business and (2) to the literature on
               competitive balance in non-team sports. Similar to competitive
               balance in team sport leagues, three dimensions can be
               distinguished in F1 racing: (1) race-specific competitive
               balance, (2) within-season competitive balance and (3)
               between-season competitive balance. In addition to classical
               tools and data, some new and F1-specific indicators, such as
               average lead changes or leading distance, are employed. Also,
               pitfalls induced especially by the used data source or

                  field of creativity faces new opportunities and challenges.
                  This manifesto explores several scenarios of human–machine
                  collaboration on creative tasks and proposes “fundamental laws
                  of generative AI” to reinforce the responsible and ethical use
                  of AI in the creativity field. Four scenarios are proposed and
                  discussed: “Co‐Cre‐AI‐tion,” “Organic,” “Plagiarism 3.0,” and
                  “Shut down,” each illustrating different possible futures
                  based on the collaboration between humans and machines. In
                  addition, we have incorporated an AI‐generated manifesto that
                  also highlights important themes, ranging from accessibility
                  and ethics to cultural sensitivity. The fundamental laws
                  proposed aim to prevent AIs from generating harmful content
                  and competing directly with humans. Creating labels and laws
                  are also highlighted to ensure responsible use of AIs. The
                  positive future of creativity and AI lies in a harmonious
                  collaboration that can benefit everyone, potentially leading
                  to a new level of creative productivity respecting ethical
                  considerations and human values during the creative process.},

                  to stimulate and foster scientific creativity. Focusing on how
                  play relates to scientific creativity in adulthood, this
                  review synthesizes the current state of knowledge in four
                  areas: the play element in scientific research, the
                  playfulness of scientists, mechanisms through which play
                  affects scientific creativity, and environmental factors key
                  to the play‐to‐create process in scientists' work. The review
                  highlights several limitations hindering further research
                  development in this area. Specifically, existing studies: (a)
                  are largely qualitative and focus on descriptive analysis of
                  the forms and/or select aspects of play, (b) do not
                  sufficiently consider the unique characteristics and processes
                  of scientific research, and (c) decontextualize the creative
                  process by separating the player‐creator from the environment.
                  Building on this analysis, the author clarifies the
                  conceptualization of play, playfulness, and scientific
                  creativity, differentiates between creative and recreative
                  play in relation to core scientific activities, and identifies
                  useful conceptual and measurement tools to facilitate future
                  domain‐specific empirical studies of play and scientific
                  creativity. Collectively, these insights advance a new
                  integrative theoretical framework—the play‐to‐create model—to
                  encourage and guide systematic and contextualized
                  investigations of how play, playfulness, creative processes,
                  and the environment interact to generate creative scientific
                  outcomes.},

                  attempted to explore how creative fixed and growth mindsets
                  shape creative outcomes and effort. Previous studies found a
                  strong association between creative mindsets and
                  self‐perceptions. However, research on the relationship
                  between creative mindsets and performance led to mixed
                  results. In an attempt to explain these confusing findings,
                  many advocated the idea that creative mindsets may influence
                  how learners utilize their domain knowledge and skills in
                  creative performance. To empirically test this assumption, we
                  investigated the influence of domain knowledge and skills on
                  the relationship between creative mindsets and performance
                  among college students (n = 125) in the context of ESL/EAL
                  writing. Our results show that a fixed creative mindset, but
                  not growth, together with ESL/EAL writing proficiency
                  contribute to ESL/EAL creative writing performance. We also
                  found that domain‐specific knowledge and skills play a role in
                  how creative mindsets translate to creative performance: while
                  endorsing a fixed mindset was detrimental for students at all
                  ESL/EAL writing proficiency levels, a growth mindset was
                  beneficial at high proficiency levels only. These findings
                  contradict the assumption that cultivating a growth creative
                  mindset will lead to positive creative outcomes for all.

                  consumers' daily lives, and they are significantly changing
                  consumer experiences. Given the novelty and pervasiveness of
                  these technologies, understanding their effects on consumer
                  well‐being is important. This research explores how
                  technological versus natural experiences in consumption
                  contribute to consumer well‐being, which is defined as
                  happiness (with its components of pleasure and meaning) and
                  life satisfaction. The results demonstrate that the type of
                  experience (i.e., natural or technological) affects meaning
                  and pleasure and, consequently, life satisfaction. These
                  effects depend on two individual characteristics: consumer
                  mindfulness and fatigue. When consumer mindfulness is high,
                  the type of experience does not affect pleasure and meaning as
                  consumers consistently derive high levels of both components
                  of happiness. However, when their mindfulness is low, pleasure
                  depends on the type of experience. Similar patterns are
                  observed for meaning, although this is affected by the level
                  of fatigue felt by consumers. Therefore, meaning is affected
                  by the two individual characteristics of mindfulness and
                  fatigue. By demonstrating the importance of consumer
                  mindfulness in protecting individuals from fatigue and the
                  potential negative effects associated with technological and
                  natural consumption experiences, this study identifies
                  practical insights that can be used to shape technological and

                  professional social network site (SNS) usage and imposter
                  syndrome. Specifically, we provide the first examination of:
                  do such sites cause imposter thoughts (“others think I am more
                  competent than I think I am”); if so, why and when this
                  happens, and what effect this has on well‐being and
                  consumption‐related results. Supported by objective
                  self‐focused attention theory and two online experiments, we
                  show that professional SNS usage heightens professional
                  self‐focused attention, triggering imposter thoughts. This
                  results in negative emotions and consumption‐related effects.
                  We further examine two boundary conditions, showing that
                  effects are reduced for individuals high in narcissism or work
                  centrality. From these findings, we extend the sociocognitive
                  theorization of the imposter phenomenon by uncovering, first,
                  context‐specific self‐focused attention as the reason “why”
                  people feel imposter‐ish in particular circumstances and

                  contribute imposter thoughts as a new alternative explanation

                  electronic word‐of‐mouth (eWOM), influence feelings of

                  conversations around brands, products, and services influence
                  older consumers' social well‐being. A 6‐month netnography was
                  conducted in a social media platform geared toward older
                  consumers where eWOM activity was created relating to books,
                  household items, technology, furniture, financial services,

                  investigate both the bright and the dark sides of
                  consumer–human brand relationships facilitated by social media
                  on consumers' lives. Grounded in the duality of social media
                  and self‐regulation theory, the findings show that human brand
                  attachment improves consumers' daily performance through
                  stress relief, which in turn increases life satisfaction
                  (Study 1). However, the findings also indicate that human
                  brand attachment can cause consumers' daily performance to
                  deteriorate as a result of compulsive human brand consumption
                  on social media and human brand‐personal conflict, which
                  diminishes life satisfaction (Study 2). Collectively, the
                  findings may suggest that strong consumer–human brand
                  relationships tend to be detrimental to consumers' well‐being
                  as the indirect negative impact of human brand attachment on
                  daily performance and life satisfaction overpowers its
                  indirect positive impact (Study 3). Such detrimental effects
                  are moderated by self‐regulatory focus (Study 4). Moreover,
                  the findings indicate that the indirect negative effect of
                  human brand attachment is attenuated when consumers have a
                  higher level of work/study–life balance. Accordingly, the
                  current research advances the theoretical understanding of the
                  consumer–human brand relationship facilitated by social media,
                  by highlighting its dual effects associated with the nature of
                  technology and consumers' self‐regulatory focuses.},

                  deliberation often occurs in the context of prior related
                  choices. This article finds that goal‐inconsistent foregone
                  alternatives, options that were previously considered but not
                  chosen, shape how consumers subsequently pursue their goals.
                  Going beyond previous research on foregone alternatives and
                  consumer satisfaction, the current research suggests that how
                  consumers mentally construe foregone goal‐inconsistent
                  alternatives impacts how they evaluate their prior
                  goal‐consistent choices, which will, in turn, impact their
                  motivation to continue making goal‐consistent choices.
                  Specifically, we find the foregone alternative diversity
                  effect: consumers who consider having previously foregone
                  diverse (vs. similar) goal‐inconsistent alternatives in favor
                  of a goal‐consistent action then believe that they have made a
                  greater sacrifice, which had more of an impact on their focal
                  goal. As a result, they are then more likely to subsequently

                  Studies 2, 3, and 5, weight loss: Study 4), and both real and
                  hypothetical choices. We also identify theoretically motivated
                  boundary conditions for the observed effect of considering

                  one sentimentally recalls events or things related to a
                  particular social identity. We investigated the relationship
                  between collective nostalgia about the United Kingdom (UK) and
                  UK citizens' desire to leave the European Union (EU). We
                  collected data of UK citizens twice prior to the UK's official
                  withdrawal from the European Union (N = 347 and N = 240) and
                  once afterwards (N = 236). Cross‐sectional and longitudinal
                  analysis, utilizing cross‐lagged panel models, supported the
                  hypothesis that collective UK nostalgia increased the desire
                  to leave the European Union. We additionally hypothesized that
                  the relationship between these variables would be mediated
                  positively by ties to UK citizens and negatively by ties to EU
                  citizens. Exploratory and longitudinal analysis, however,
                  indicated that strength of ties to UK and EU citizens predicts
                  levels of collective UK nostalgia which, in turn, predicts
                  desire to leave the European Union. Specifically, ties to UK
                  citizens were associated with increased collective nostalgia
                  and a desire to leave the EU and ties to EU citizens were
                  associated with reduced collective nostalgia and a desire to
                  re‐join the European Union. We discuss the implications of the
                  findings as well as making suggestions for future studies.},

                  aspects of old roles into their new work contexts, and this
                  interface can create conflict between lingering aspects of
                  one's work self and the newer aspects of one's work self. Yet,
                  we know little about how this conflict between old and new
                  selves shapes employee outcomes. We examine this issue among
                  ex‐entrepreneurs—individuals who have transitioned from a
                  business owner to a wage employee. Drawing from role identity
                  theory, we develop a model of the consequences of conflict
                  between a lingering entrepreneur identity and a current work
                  role identity. We propose that ex‐entrepreneurs who experience
                  higher levels of identity conflict will be more likely to
                  experience burnout and less likely to engage in boosterism of
                  their employer, and that these relationships are explained by
                  lower levels of perceived professional identity growth (i.e.,
                  progressive identity). We further suggest that the negative
                  effect of conflict on progressive identity is exacerbated by
                  nostalgia for one's entrepreneurial past. In a three‐stage
                  field survey of ex‐entrepreneurs and their romantic partners,
                  we found support for these hypotheses using both partner‐rated
                  outcomes and self‐rated outcomes. We discuss implications for
                  the literature on entrepreneurship careers and work identity
                  in organizations.},

  abstract     = {Psychological science tends to treat subjective well-being and
                  happiness synonymously. We start from the assumption that
                  subjective well-being is more than being happy to ask the
                  fundamental question: What is the ideal level of happiness?
                  From a cross-cultural perspective, we propose that the
                  idealization of attaining maximum levels of happiness may be
                  especially characteristic of Western, educated, industrial,
                  rich, and democratic (WEIRD) societies but less so for others.
                  Searching for an explanation for why “happiness maximization”
                  might have emerged in these societies, we turn to studies
                  linking cultures to their eco-environmental habitat. We
                  discuss the premise that WEIRD cultures emerged in an
                  exceptionally benign ecological habitat (i.e., faced
                  relatively light existential pressures compared with other
                  regions). We review the influence of the Gulf Stream on the
                  Northwestern European climate as a source of these
                  comparatively benign geographical conditions. We propose that
                  the ecological conditions in which WEIRD societies emerged
                  afforded them a basis to endorse happiness as a value and to
                  idealize attaining its maximum level. To provide a nomological
                  network for happiness maximization, we also studied some of
                  its potential side effects, namely alcohol and drug
                  consumption and abuse and the prevalence of mania. To evaluate
                  our hypothesis, we reanalyze data from two large-scale studies
                  on ideal levels of personal life satisfaction—the most common
                  operationalization of happiness in psychology—involving
                  respondents from 61 countries. We conclude that societies
                  whose members seek to maximize happiness tend to be
                  characterized as WEIRD, and generalizing this across societies
                  can prove problematic if adopted at the ideological and policy
                  level.},

                  as one of the triggers of landmarks, a phenomenon that has not

                  The research is composed of one pilot study and three
                  experiments to test our research hypotheses. The results show
                  that end temporal landmarks trigger feelings of nostalgia,
                  which leads to nostalgic consumption through the need to
                  belong. This study underscores the mediating role of the need
                  to belong, which plays an important role in leading to
                  nostalgic consumption. Building upon theoretical perspectives
                  on the need to belong, our study enriches the research

                  showing that consumer nostalgic consumption can become a

                  helps in regaining connection and supporting social
                  relationship networks. Marketers may use the signs of end
                  temporal landmarks to increase consumers’ nostalgia, which, in
                  turn, will enhance consumers’ need to belong and thus lead to
                  the purchasing and consumption of nostalgic products.},

                  Anecdotes about ideas spontaneously entering awareness during
                  walks, showers, and other off‐task activities are plenty. The
                  science behind it, however, is still inconclusive. Creativity
                  might result from how thought context—whether thoughts are
                  on‐task or off‐task—relates to thought dynamics—how thoughts
                  unfold. To explore this, study 1 (n = 85) surveyed creative
                  professionals about a single idea they had earlier in the day.
                  The spontaneity of thoughts positively correlated with
                  self‐reported creativity, whereas off‐task thoughts or doing
                  something else did not. Study 2 (n = 180) replicated these
                  findings in a student sample during an idea generation task
                  and added that free movement of thoughts also correlates with
                  self‐reported originality during idea generation. As indicated
                  by expert ratings, no relationship of thought dynamics and
                  thought context was found with population‐level creativity.
                  Herewith, this study suggests that thought dynamics, rather
                  than thought context, explain the often suggested relationship
                  between mind wandering and creativity.},

                  social and personality psychologists have increased attention
                  to power analysis and the adequacy of sample sizes. In this
                  article, we analyze current controversies in this area,
                  including choosing effect sizes, why and whether power
                  analyses should be conducted on already-collected data, how to
                  mitigate the negative effects of sample size criteria on
                  specific kinds of research, and which power criterion to use.
                  For novel research questions, we advocate that researchers
                  base sample sizes on effects that are likely to be
                  cost-effective for other people to implement (in applied
                  settings) or to study (in basic research settings), given the

                  psychology has been criticized for basing some of its
                  conclusions on studies with low numbers of participants. As a
                  result, power analysis, a mathematical way to ensure that a
                  study has enough participants to reliably “detect” a given
                  size of psychological effect, has become popular. This article
                  describes power analysis and discusses some controversies
                  about it, including how researchers should derive assumptions
                  about effect size, and how the requirements of power analysis
                  can be applied without harming research on hard-to-reach and
                  marginalized communities. For novel research questions, we

                  rapidly in recent years, as has commercial interest in more
                  science‐based approaches to the practice, particularly as more
                  brands and agencies look for qualitative and quantitative
                  evidence to support the efficacy of sonic branding. In this
                  research note, we explore the ways in which the design and
                  execution (i.e., the “art”) of sonic branding initiatives can
                  be informed by overlapping approaches and techniques drawn
                  from the sciences, namely psychoacoustics, semiotics,
                  music/auditory cognition, and crossmodal research. We explore
                  whether the rapid growth of generative AI may represent the
                  next major evolution in the design, creation, and assessment
                  of sonic assets, where science and art are used to train AI
                  tools that could one day augment (and potentially disrupt) the

                  will likely remain as much an art as a science, though basing
                  one's approach on the emerging scientific literature ought to
                  at least tilt the odds of success in the creative's favor.},

                  consumer involvement in storytelling (to create memorable and
                  emotionally resonant experiences) in hospitality marketing
                  through four phases: qualitative inquiry, construct
                  definition, item refinement, and nomological validation.
                  Validation involves 24 in‐depth video interviews and
                  consecutive online surveys. The hospitality marketing
                  storytelling involvement scale, with four
                  dimensions—contextual cues, emotional engagement, mental
                  cognition, and immersive experience—comprising 14 items,
                  precisely measures consumer involvement. The scale integrates
                  narrative transportation theory and the elaboration likelihood
                  model to enhance understanding of consumer engagement with
                  fundamental human cognitive and emotional processes. The
                  validated scale offers a valuable tool for marketers to
                  precisely assess consumer involvement and strategically
                  leverage storytelling to evoke emotions, foster brand loyalty,
                  and judge campaign effectiveness. In diverse marketing
                  contexts that elicit emotions, resonate with individuals, and
                  foster immersive experiences, the scale demonstrates
                  remarkable adaptability. Ultimately, it can help marketers
                  craft compelling narratives, enhance brand perception, and
                  strengthen consumer relationships, thereby contributing to
                  emotional connections, optimizing strategies, and enhancing
                  consumer engagement effectiveness.},

                  (ML)-based modeling to enhance students’ argumentation
                  skills—a crucial component in education and professional
                  success. Traditional educational tools often rely on static
                  modeling, which does not adapt to individual learner needs or
                  provide real-time feedback. In contrast, our research
                  introduces an innovative ML-based system designed to offer
                  dynamic, personalized feedback on argumentation skills. We
                  conducted three empirical studies comparing this system
                  against traditional methods such as scripted and adaptive
                  support modeling. Our results show that dynamic behavioral
                  modeling significantly improves learners’ objective
                  argumentation skills across domains, outperforming all
                  established methods. The results further indicate that,
                  compared with adaptive support, the effect of the dynamic
                  modeling approach holds across complex (large effect) and
                  simple tasks (medium effect) and supports learners with lower
                  and higher expertise alike. This research has important
                  implications for educational policy and practice;
                  incorporating such dynamic systems could transform learning
                  environments by providing scalable, individualized support.
                  This would not only foster essential skills but also cater to
                  diverse learner profiles, potentially reducing educational
                  disparities. Our work suggests a shift toward integrating more
                  adaptive technologies in educational settings to better
                  prepare students for the demands of the modern workforce.},

  abstract     = {Abstract This research uses a crowdfunding context to examine
                  when and why a simple difference in frame—using “want” versus
                  “need” in the request—affects funders’ compliance with an
                  appeal for contributions. Building on the semantic framing and
                  psycholinguistics literature, we propose that using “want”
                  (vs. “need”) signals that the fundraiser is a relatively less
                  (vs. more) dependent person. This perception difference then
                  exerts opposing effects on the two major forms of crowdfunding
                  appeals. For reward-based appeals, in which fundraisers
                  promise a return on contribution, funders have a for-profit
                  (i.e., incentive-seeking) goal and are more willing to
                  contribute to a less dependent fundraiser. In contrast, for
                  donation-based appeals, in which no incentives are promised by
                  the fundraisers, funders are primarily motivated by a
                  nonprofit (i.e., helping) goal and are more willing to
                  contribute to a fundraiser who is seen as more dependent on
                  help. Therefore, we predict that a “want” (vs. “need”) frame
                  is more effective in reward-based (vs. donation-based)
                  crowdfunding. Results from two large-scale observational
                  studies and four experiments support our predictions and also
                  illuminate the underlying mechanisms. Collectively, the
                  findings contribute to the literature on semantic framing and
                  crowdfunding and also offer practical implications for
                  fundraisers, marketers, and policymakers.},

                  However, researchers struggle to design and write
                  non-empirical articles because of the lack of commonly
                  accepted templates to guide their development. The aim of this
                  paper is to highlight methodological considerations for
                  conceptual papers: it is argued that such papers must be
                  grounded in a clear research design, and that the choice of
                  theories and their role in the analysis must be explicated and

                  learning in two‐stage matching models to deal with sample
                  selection bias. Recent advances in machine learning have
                  unlocked new empirical possibilities for inductive theorizing.
                  In contrast, the opportunities to use machine learning in
                  regression studies involving large‐scale data with many
                  covariates and a causal claim are still less well understood.
                  Our core contribution is to guide researchers in the use of
                  machine learning approaches to choosing matching variables for
                  enhanced causal inference in propensity score matching models.
                  We use an analysis of real‐world technology invention data of
                  public–private relationships to demonstrate the method and
                  find that machine learning can provide an alternative approach
                  to ad hoc matching. However, as with any method, it is also
                  important to understand its limitations.Managerial SummaryThis
                  article explores the use of machine learning to enhance
                  decision‐making, particularly in addressing sample selection
                  bias in large‐scale datasets. The rapid development of AI and
                  machine learning offers new, powerful tools especially for
                  digital ecosystems where complex data and causal relationships
                  are complex to analyze. We offer managers and stakeholders
                  insight into the effective integration of machine learning for
                  selecting critical variables in propensity score matching
                  models. Through a detailed examination of real‐world data on
                  technology inventions within public–private relationships, we
                  demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning as a robust
                  alternative to traditional matching methods.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Decision making is frequently associated with risk
                  taking under uncertainty. Elevated intolerance of uncertainty
                  is suggested to be a critical feature of obsessive-compulsive
                  disorder (OCD). However, impairments of latent constructs of
                  uncertainty processing and its neural correlates remain
                  unclear in OCD. METHODS: In 83 participants (24 OCD patients
                  treated with capsulotomy, 28 OCD control participants, and 31
                  healthy control participants), we performed magnetic resonance
                  imaging using a card gambling task in which participants made
                  decisions whether to bet or not that the next card would be
                  larger than the current one. A hierarchical drift diffusion
                  model was used to dissociate speed and amount of evidence
                  accumulated before a decisional threshold (i.e., betting or no
                  betting) was reached. RESULTS: High uncertainty was
                  characterized by a smaller amount of evidence accumulation
                  (lower thresholds), thus dissociating uncertainty from
                  conflict tasks and highlighting the specificity of this task
                  to test value-based uncertainty. OCD patients exhibited
                  greater caution with poor performance and greater evidence
                  accumulation overall along with slower speed of accumulation,
                  particularly under low uncertainty. Bilateral dorsal anterior
                  cingulate and anterior insula distinguished high- and
                  low-uncertainty decision processes in healthy control
                  participants but not in the OCD groups, indicating impairments
                  in anticipation of differences in outcome variance and
                  salience network activity. There were no behavioral or imaging
                  differences relating to capsulotomy despite improvements in
                  OCD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight greater
                  impairments particularly in more certain trials in the OCD
                  groups along with impaired neural differentiation of high and
                  low uncertainty and suggest uncertainty processing as a trait
                  cognitive endophenotype rather than a state-specific factor.},

                  genuine novelty and new knowledge and, in turn, that AI and
                  computational models of cognition will replace human decision
                  making under uncertainty. We disagree. We argue that AI’s
                  data-based prediction is different from human theory-based
                  causal logic and reasoning. We highlight problems with the
                  decades-old analogy between computers and minds as
                  input–output devices, using large language models as an
                  example. Human cognition is better conceptualized as a form of
                  theory-based causal reasoning rather than AI’s emphasis on
                  information processing and data-based prediction. AI uses a
                  probability-based approach to knowledge and is largely
                  backward looking and imitative, whereas human cognition is
                  forward-looking and capable of generating genuine novelty. We
                  introduce the idea of data–belief asymmetries to highlight the
                  difference between AI and human cognition, using the example
                  of heavier-than-air flight to illustrate our arguments.
                  Theory-based causal reasoning provides a cognitive mechanism
                  for humans to intervene in the world and to engage in directed
                  experimentation to generate new data. Throughout the article,
                  we discuss the implications of our argument for understanding

                  because the AI‐assisted design process has the potential to be
                  more efficient and cost‐ and time‐effective. Under the mind
                  perception theory, this study examines how consumers evaluate
                  AI's experiential and intentional abilities and respond to
                  AI‐designed versus human‐designed fashion products. The
                  results of the three online experiments indicate that
                  human‐designed products are generally more favorably evaluated
                  than AI‐designed ones. Such preference was mainly because
                  people ascribe a better intentional capacity to act and plan
                  to humans than AI, which makes them believe humans have better
                  design expertise. The preference for human design over AI
                  design was found regardless of one's tendency to perceive AI
                  threats. The receptivity to the AI design is increased for
                  highly functional (vs. self‐expressive) products, but such a
                  moderating effect of product type may not hold in
                  intra‐product comparisons. Incorporating human elements into
                  the AI‐assisted design process when introducing the products
                  can alleviate the negative responses, but the effectiveness
                  can vary depending on the levels of human elements. This study
                  contributes to the literature by finding the perceptual
                  superiority of human design and suggesting the potential of

                  intergroup contact, surpassing the perceived naturalism and
                  emotional salience of other online contact experiences. By
                  embodying an avatar of ingroup characteristics, one can

                  assessed the impact of intergroup contact in VR on implicit
                  and explicit attitudes towards Black people. Utilizing the VR
                  app AltspaceVR, participants were immersed in a virtual
                  environment as White avatars to play an interactive game with
                  another player represented as a Black (intergroup contact) or
                  White avatar (intragroup contact). In Study 1, the avatars
                  played the game as a team to win against other teams. The
                  participants’ attitudes were assessed both pre- and
                  postcontact using questionnaires and the Implicit Association
                  Test (IAT). In Study 2, participants were randomly assigned to
                  either cooperate (play as a team) or compete (play against
                  each other) in the game. The IAT and explicit attitudes were
                  measured postcontact. The findings from both studies revealed
                  that cooperative contact with a Black avatar led to improved
                  attitudes towards Black people. While Study 1 demonstrated an
                  improvement in explicit attitudes, Study 2 demonstrated
                  positive effects of contact at the implicit level exclusively.
                  Additionally, the positive impact of contact on implicit
                  attitudes was observed following cooperative, rather than
                  competitive, intergroup interactions.},

                  beyond gift choice, the present work explores a novel type of
                  giver–recipient mismatch—beliefs about the importance of
                  sending an on‐time gift. Specifically, the current work offers
                  evidence that gift givers systematically overestimate the
                  negative impact that a late occasion‐based gift will have on
                  their relationship with the recipient, which occurs because
                  gift givers believe that sending a late gift will signal that
                  they care about the recipient to a lesser extent than what the
                  recipient perceives. As such, gift givers' overestimation of
                  relationship harm from a late gift is attenuated when they
                  signal care in some other way (e.g., with the amount of effort
                  put into creating the gift). Finally, we explore the
                  consequences of degree of gift lateness as well as the
                  decision to not send an occasion‐based gift at all on gift

                  happiness, the less happy they are. For whom and why is this
                  the case? To answer these questions, we examined a model of
                  happiness pursuit that disentangles two previously conflated
                  individual differences related to valuing happiness. The first
                  individual difference operates at the strength of the value
                  itself and involves viewing happiness as a very important goal
                  (i.e., aspiring to happiness). The second individual
                  difference occurs later in the process of pursuing happiness
                  and involves judging one's levels of happiness (i.e., concern
                  about happiness). This model predicts that aspiring to
                  happiness is relatively innocuous. Conversely, being concerned
                  about happiness leads people to judge their happiness, thereby
                  infusing negativity (i.e., negative meta-emotions) into
                  potentially positive events, which, in turn, interferes with
                  well-being. We tested these hypotheses using cross-sectional,
                  daily-diary, and longitudinal methods in student and community
                  samples, collected between 2009 and 2020, which are diverse in
                  gender, ethnicity, age, and geographic location (Ntotal =
                  1,815). In Studies 1a and 1b, aspiring to happiness and
                  concern about happiness represented distinct individual
                  differences. In Study 2, concern about happiness (but not
                  aspiring to happiness) was associated with lower well-being
                  cross-sectionally and longitudinally. In Study 3, these links
                  between concern about happiness and worse well-being were
                  partially accounted for by experiencing greater negative
                  meta-emotions during daily positive events. These findings
                  suggest that highly valuing happiness is not inherently
                  problematic; however, concern and judgment about one's
                  happiness can undermine it. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024

                  whether and how music listening impacts cognition and affect
                  in healthy older adults, specifically considering the
                  emotional connotations of music (happy- or sad-sounding music)
                  and its presentation modality (background or prior to the
                  tasks). Based on the PRISMA guidelines and preregistering in
                  PROSPERO (CRD42022366520), we searched the Scopus, PsycInfo,
                  and Web of Science databases. Out of 2,675 articles, 27 met
                  the inclusion criteria. The synthesized findings on cognition
                  (23 studies) revealed an uncertain influence of music type and
                  presentation modalities on memory outcomes. In contrast,
                  happy-sounding music seems to support executive functioning (2
                  out of 4) and processing speed (1), when presented in the
                  background, and facilitate language processes (2 out of 3),
                  when given prior to the task. However, the high heterogeneity
                  and inconsistency in the music type and presentation
                  modalities, as well as in the cognitive outcomes considered,
                  prevented us from drawing clear conclusions on the effect of
                  music listening on older adults’ cognition. For affective
                  outcomes, a narrative synthesis of the findings on mood (12
                  studies) and arousal (7 studies) outcomes showed that,
                  regardless of music presentation modality, happy- and
                  sad-sounding music increase or decrease mood/valence and
                  arousal, respectively. Results from meta-analysis showed no
                  significant cognitive benefits from music listening (SMD =
                  0.09, [95\% CI: −0.17, 0.35], p = 0.51) and suggest a positive
                  effect of happy-sounding music on arousal (SMD = 0.44 [95\%
                  CI: 0.13, 0.74], p = 0.005), but not on valence (SMD = 0.79
                  [95\% CI: −0.25, 1.84], p = 0.14). The methodological
                  shortcomings of the extant literature call upon the need for
                  further studies adopting more rigorous and consistent
                  approaches that better elucidate the potential benefits of
                  music listening on cognitive and affective outcomes among

                  opinions of others who have past experience with it, for
                  example, by browsing online reviews. This research finds that
                  the persuasive impact of such reviews depends on their
                  temporal context: Consumers view the same review as less
                  persuasive when tagged with proximate temporal markers (e.g.,
                  “Bought this one day ago”) versus distant temporal markers
                  (e.g., “Bought this one year ago”). This happens because
                  consumers infer from temporal markers that the reviewer must
                  be (in)sufficiently experienced. These effects emerged both in
                  the field (Experiment 1) and in controlled contexts using
                  varied products (Experiments 2a, 2b) and across valence, such
                  that proximate temporal markers undermined recommendations
                  from positive reviews but also softened criticisms from
                  negative reviews (Experiments 3, 4a,b). Accordingly, the
                  effects were moderated by conditions that restored perceptions
                  of the reviewer's experience in other ways beyond time
                  (Experiments 5–7). Together, these findings highlight how
                  consumers draw reviewer inferences from temporal markers in
                  reviews, which bear on the review's persuasiveness. The
                  undermining impact of proximate temporal markers may be
                  increasingly relevant in today's online review landscape,
                  where speedy reviews have become the expected norm. Temporal
                  markers may wield unintended effects on review persuasion,
                  holding the review constant.},

                  phenomenon whereby firms incorporate the “street” names
                  consumers give brands into their own marketing (e.g.,
                  Bloomingdale's opening a “Bloomie's” store). While
                  practitioners anticipate positive results from deploying this
                  tactic, the current research serves as the first empirical
                  investigation of its likely effectiveness. Drawing on speech
                  act theory, the authors theorize that using a nickname in
                  place of a formal name serves as an act of power
                  redistribution, effectively signaling submission to consumers,
                  thereby reducing the perception of a brand's power and
                  weakening its performance. Through a multimethod approach that
                  incorporates secondary data analyses, field studies, and
                  preregistered experiments, the results support this view
                  across a range of performance metrics. In addition, the
                  authors show that this effect is contingent on two factors,
                  such that nickname branding (1) harms performance more for
                  competent brands than warm brands and (2) is less pronounced
                  when nicknames are used in messages that are communal-oriented
                  (vs. transactional-oriented). This research introduces a new
                  theoretical perspective centering on the illocutionary
                  meanings embedded in the process of naming brands and

                  (SCC), scarcity perceptions, and the associated behavioral
                  consequences. While scarcity perceptions are often linked to
                  experiences and considerations of resource constraints, our
                  research suggests that low SCC can induce such perceptions and
                  decrease prosocial behavior. With six studies, we demonstrated
                  that low SCC triggers scarcity perceptions (Studies 1A to 4B),
                  which is mediated by increased social comparison orientation
                  (Studies 2 to 4B). Furthermore, we found that the scarcity
                  perceptions increased by low SCC further predict individuals'
                  low inclination to engage in prosocial behaviors (Studies 3 to
                  4B). By establishing a link between SCC and scarcity
                  perceptions, our research departs from the traditional focus
                  on resource constraints, broadens the factors that induce
                  scarcity perceptions, and extends our understanding of the
                  societal implications of low SCC.},

                  and why some theories in sport management emerge and are
                  adopted while others are not. Borrowing from Winston’s model
                  of technological diffusion, supervening necessities are what
                  allow some prototypes to transform into inventions; in the
                  social sphere of sport management, they are the drivers of new
                  concepts that are adopted and employed as theories in the
                  field. However, Winston notes that within the social sphere
                  are brakes that serve to slow their emergence. In turn,
                  theories develop in sport management under similar conflicting
                  pressures. It is these contrary forces that slow the diffusion

                  We illustrate how AI could augment existing SDM tools and
                  provide empirical evidence from a leading accelerator program
                  and a start-up competition that current large language models
                  can generate and evaluate strategies at a level comparable to
                  entrepreneurs and investors. We then examine implications for
                  the key cognitive processes underlying SDM—search,
                  representation, and aggregation. Our analysis suggests that AI
                  has the potential to enhance the speed, quality, and scale of
                  strategic analysis, while also enabling new approaches, like
                  virtual strategy simulations. However, the ultimate impact on
                  firm performance will depend on competitive dynamics as AI
                  capabilities progress. We propose a framework connecting AI
                  use in SDM to firm outcomes and discuss how AI may reshape
                  sources of competitive advantage. We conclude by considering
                  how AI could both support and challenge core tenets of the
                  theory-based view of strategy. Overall, our work maps out an

                  image and consumer perceptions. This study leveraged five case
                  studies involving elite athletes and their brands, with the

                  personality, self-congruity, uncertainty avoidance, and
                  tourists’ revisit intention. The present conceptual paper
                  proposed an integrated model of self-congruity which
                  incorporates the effect of uncertainty avoidance. More
                  importantly, the uncertainty avoidance was introduced as a
                  moderator between self-congruity and revisit intention. Based
                  on the theoretical framework proposed in this article, the
                  estimated results affirmed the applicability of the theory of
                  self-congruity for tourism research. Moreover, by extending

                  global evaluations of a person can induce altered evaluations
                  of the person's attributes, even when there is sufficient
                  information to allow for independent assessments of them.
                  Furthermore, Ss were unaware of this influence of global
                  evaluations on ratings of attributes. In fact, Ss who saw the
                  cold instructor actually believed that the direction of
                  influence was opposite to the true direction. They reported
                  that their dislike of the instructor had no effect on their
                  rating of his attributes but that their dislike of his
                  attributes had lowered their global evaluations of him.

                  the tourism economy and globalization since the 1990s; people
                  from different ethnic groups might adopt cultural traits from
                  outside their group or lose their own culture at different
                  rates. Human behavioural ecology can help to explain adoption
                  of outgroup cultural values. We compared the adoption of four
                  cultural values, specifically speaking outgroup
                  languages/mother tongue and wearing jeans, in two co-residing
                  ethnic groups, the Mosuo and Han. Both groups are learning
                  outgroup traits, including each other's languages through
                  contact in economic activities, education and kin networks,
                  but only the Mosuo are starting to lose their own language.
                  Males are more likely to adopt outgroup values than females in
                  both groups. Females of the two groups are no different in
                  speaking Mandarin and wearing jeans, whereas males do differ,
                  with Mosuo males being keener to adopt them than Han males.
                  The reason might be that Mosuo men experience more
                  reproductive competition over mates, as Mosuo men have larger
                  reproductive skew than others. Moreover, Mosuo men but not
                  others gain fitness benefits from the adoption of Mandarin
                  (they start reproducing earlier than non-speakers). This

                  quantile regressions and copula-based conditional
                  value-at-risk (CoVaR) measures, the results are as follows.
                  First, consumer confidence and uncertainties significantly
                  impact the travel and leisure index returns across various
                  quantiles, however, the impact is stronger at the left tail
                  than the right tail; furthermore, the sign and magnitude of

                  speak to this question. However, many of them were conducted

                  creating uncertainty about how many discoveries might be false
                  positives. To prevent p-hacking, happiness researchers
                  increasingly preregister their studies, committing to analysis
                  plans before analyzing data. We conducted a systematic
                  literature search to identify preregistered experiments
                  testing strategies for increasing happiness. We found
                  surprisingly little support for many widely recommended
                  strategies (e.g., performing random acts of kindness).
                  However, our review suggests that other strategies—such as
                  being more sociable—may reliably promote happiness. We also

                  explaining the variation observed in knowledge transfer. Key
                  factors identified as explaining the variation include
                  knowledge transfer opportunities, knowledge characteristics,
                  mechanisms for knowledge transfer, motivation for transfer,

                  order to change unjust and harmful social norms, it is crucial
                  to identify the psychological processes that give rise to
                  them. Most researchers take it for granted that social norms
                  are uniquely human. By contrast, we approach this matter from
                  a comparative perspective, leveraging recent research on
                  animal social behaviour. While there is currently only
                  suggestive evidence for norms in nonhuman communities, we
                  argue that human social norms are likely produced by a wide
                  range of mechanisms, many of which we share with nonhuman
                  animals. Approaching this variability from a comparative
                  perspective can help norm researchers expand and reframe the
                  range of hypotheses they test when attempting to understand
                  the causes of socially normative behaviours in humans. First,
                  we diagnose some of the theoretical obstacles to developing a
                  comparative science of social norms, and offer a few basic
                  constructs and distinctions to help norm researchers overcome
                  these obstacles. Then we develop a six-dimensional model of
                  the psychological and social factors that contribute to
                  variability in both human and potential nonhuman norms. This

                  extensive interactions with practice, the authors propose a
                  multidimensional framework for understanding the impact of AI
                  involving intelligence levels, task types, and whether AI is
                  embedded in a robot. Prior research typically addresses a
                  subset of these dimensions; this paper integrates all three
                  into a single framework. Next, the authors propose a research
                  agenda that addresses not only how marketing strategies and
                  customer behaviors will change in the future, but also
                  highlights important policy questions relating to privacy,

                  status perceptions that index the social standing of

                  the current review, we crystallize knowledge regarding the
                  nature of status by characterizing variability in definitions,
                  measures, and analytic frameworks. We advocate a definition of
                  status that draws together attributes of respect, admiration,
                  and voluntary deference. We also distinguish reputational and
                  relational status operationalizations and address implications
                  pertaining to measurement along with downstream decisions
                  involving data management and analysis. We encourage a
                  deliberate approach to ensure congruency in how status is
                  defined, measured, and analyzed within a research program.
                  This review also guides theory and hypothesis generation
                  regarding how status-related processes may vary based on

                  options will not meet these needs. Recent attempts to adopt
                  risk‐sensitivity as a framework for understanding human
                  decision‐making have been promising. However, this research
                  has focused on individual‐level decision‐making, has not

                  examined the influence of multiple levels of need on
                  decision‐making under risk. We examined group‐level

                  leagues: the National Football League (NFL) and the National

                  creative embodied activities have been neglected in both
                  applied and research settings. To address this gap, this study
                  examined the effects of a Creative Dance program on university
                  students' creative self‐efficacy, emotional creativity,
                  tolerance to ambiguity, and ideation behaviors. A total of 143
                  undergraduate students participated, either in the Creative
                  Dance intervention or a sport‐based control group for 15
                  weeks. A mixed‐method approach using questionnaires and focus
                  groups was adopted. Linear mixed effects models showed that
                  engaging in Creative Dance had a significant effect on
                  ideational behaviors and tolerance to ambiguity. Specifically,
                  students in the intervention condition improved their
                  ideational behaviors and remained stable in their tolerance to
                  ambiguity compared to student in the control condition who
                  remained stable and regressed on those variables respectively.

                  food-storing birds. One of the beauties of the food-storing
                  system was that inherent in the behaviour were the elements
                  that (at the time) made up episodic memory: what, where and
                  when. While there were then already plenty of data on animals’
                  ability to put together what and where, the addition of the
                  time element in animals’ memory and its testing was one that
                  was both new and experimentally challenging. It has, however,
                  led to an increasing variety of examples showing that animals
                  can put together all three informational components. If
                  episodic memories can be described as those memories that make
                  any one of us who we are, why should non-human animals have
                  such memories? Here, we argue that episodic memories play a
                  significant functional role in the lives of real animals, in
                  particular, enabling them to make decisions about how they
                  might or should act in their future. We support our argument
                  with data from a range of examples, focussing on data from the
                  field. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Elements of

                  more or less variety. When planning a weekend for oneself and
                  one's spouse, for example, a person could choose more varied
                  activities (e.g., going out to dinner, to a movie, and to a
                  concert) or less varied activities (e.g., seeing several
                  different movies). What might affect how much variety people
                  choose? Five experiments demonstrate that how much variety
                  consumers prefer for joint consumption in committed
                  relationships depends on their relationship time perspective
                  (i.e., the perceived time ahead in the relationship). When
                  consumers perceive more (vs. less) time ahead in a committed
                  relationship, they prefer more variety for joint consumption
                  with their partners. This increased preference for variety is
                  driven by a shift in how much excitement is valued within the
                  relationship and is unique to choices for joint consumption
                  with the specific relationship partner. The findings
                  demonstrate that variety preferences depend not just on

                  authors explore when and why this is true in a wide variety of
                  domains. They find that algorithms are trusted and relied on
                  less for tasks that seem subjective (vs. objective) in nature.
                  However, they show that perceived task objectivity is
                  malleable and that increasing a task’s perceived objectivity
                  increases trust in and use of algorithms for that task.
                  Consumers mistakenly believe that algorithms lack the
                  abilities required to perform subjective tasks. Increasing
                  algorithms’ perceived affective human-likeness is therefore

                  thereby contributing to our understanding of how to advance
                  social action and propel a social movement. Our climate action
                  framework builds on: (1) individuals we describe as climate
                  upstanders who rise up to take climate action with like‐minded
                  others, and (2) communities of climate upstanders who engage

                  tennis did not receive much attention from academics in the
                  recent past. This is astonishing because it should be of
                  utmost importance in professional tennis in the following
                  years with the approaching end of the era of the Big 3. This
                  study investigates match-level uncertainty in professional
                  women's and men's tennis between 2010 and 2019 using a logit
                  model with a dataset consisting of 51,054 matches. In the
                  different analyses, the variations in the ranking and quality
                  differences between players are taken into account in addition
                  to differences across surfaces, tournaments, and genders. In
                  the investigated period, women's tennis has relatively higher
                  outcome uncertainty when compared to men's. The results also
                  illustrate that talent seems to be distributed more evenly in
                  women's tennis, whereas men's tennis has high heterogeneity in

  abstract     = {AbstractFirst-generation college students often develop
                  negative thoughts and expectations about whether they belong
                  in college and whether they can be successful in college, and
                  these negative thoughts play a major role in college retention
                  and success. Nostalgia, a mixed but mostly positive emotional
                  experience that involves reflecting on personally meaningful
                  events from one’s life, has been found to promote an
                  optimistic future orientation. We tested the applied value of
                  nostalgia’s future-orienting capacity for fostering positive
                  beliefs about college belonging and success among
                  first-generation college students in 2 experiments. In
                  Experiment 1, first-generation students who reflected on a
                  nostalgic event from their past reported more positive beliefs
                  about their potential to discover a sense of belonging in
                  their college community, compared to first-generation students
                  who reflected on an ordinary event. In Experiment 2, nostalgic
                  reflection once again increased positive expectations for
                  belonging in first-generation college students as well as
                  optimism for academic success. We conclude that the power of
                  nostalgia to promote a positive future orientation may be
                  harnessed by institutions and programs looking to encourage
                  belonging and optimism to help first-generation college
                  students adjust to and succeed in college.},

               one of the largest forms of leisure behavior in the world. With
               the establishment of the digital ecosystem in the sports
               landscape, a large part of any fan’s consumption of sport and
               manifestations of their fandom occurs through digital platforms.
               Sports fans can now consume news and other content via digital
               platforms on mobile whenever and wherever they are. Fans no
               longer need to attend the game or even congregate at pubs or
               physical spaces with other fans to share the experience; they can
               do all of this digitally providing an enriched fandom experience.
               Researchers have been observing and studying the impact of the
               digital ecosystem on fandom and how this impacts fans, athletes,
               and sport organizations alike. This chapter provides insight into
               how fandom in the digital ecosystem manifests, starting with an
               overview of how one becomes a sport fan before moving into how
               sport fandom in the digital ecosystem has evolved in the last
               decade of digital fandom research. The chapter concludes with a
               discussion of some of the challenges of digital sport fandom with
               respect to diversity and the dark side of the digital ecosystem.
               Woven throughout the chapter are insights into the research
               opportunities that still exist in the realm of digital sport

                  or future, and relates to experiential aspects of episodic
                  memory, and episodic future thinking. Framing episodic memory
                  and future thinking in this way causes a challenge when
                  studying memory in animals, where demonstration of this mental
                  projection is prevented by the absence of language. However,
                  there is good evidence that non-human animals pass tests of
                  episodic memory that are based on behavioural criteria,
                  meaning a better understanding needs to be had of the
                  relationship between episodic memory and mental time travel.
                  We argue that mental time travel and episodic memory are not
                  synonymous, and that mental time travel is neither a
                  requirement of, nor an irrelevance to, episodic memory. Mental
                  time travel can allow improved behavioural choices based on
                  episodic memory, and work in all species (including humans)
                  should include careful consideration of the behavioural
                  outputs being measured. This article is part of the theme

                  mental time travel has immensely enriched our understanding of
                  human cognition. However, his focus on human psychology, with
                  limited consideration of evolutionary perspectives, led to the
                  entrenched notion that mental time travel is uniquely human.
                  We contend that adopting a phylogenetic perspective offers a
                  deeper insight into cognition, revealing it as a continuous
                  evolutionary process. Adherence to the uniqueness of
                  pre-defined psychological concepts obstructs a more complete
                  understanding. We offer a concise natural history to elucidate
                  how events that occurred hundreds of millions of years ago
                  have been pivotal for our ability to mentally time travel. We
                  discuss how the human brain, utilizing parts with ancient
                  origins in a networked manner, enables mental time travel.
                  This underscores that episodic memories and mental time travel
                  are not isolated mental constructs but integral to our
                  perception and representation of the world. We conclude by
                  examining recent evidence of neuroanatomical correlates found
                  only in great apes, which show great variability, indicating
                  the ongoing evolution of mental time travel in humans. This

  abstract     = {While many aspects of cognition have been shown to be shared
                  between humans and non-human animals, there remains
                  controversy regarding whether the capacity to mentally time
                  travel is a uniquely human one. In this paper, we argue that
                  there are four ways of representing when some event happened:
                  four kinds of temporal representation . Distinguishing these
                  four kinds of temporal representation has five benefits.
                  First, it puts us in a position to determine the particular
                  benefits these distinct temporal representations afford an
                  organism. Second, it provides the conceptual resources to
                  foster a discussion about which of these representations is
                  necessary for an organism to count as having the capacity to
                  mentally time travel. Third, it enables us to distinguish
                  stricter from more liberal views of mental time travel that
                  differ regarding which kind(s) of temporal representation is
                  taken to be necessary for mental time travel. Fourth, it
                  allows us to determine the benefits of taking a stricter or
                  more liberal view of mental time travel. Finally, it ensures
                  that disagreement about whether some species can mentally time
                  travel is not merely the product of unrecognized disagreement
                  about which temporal representation is necessary for mental
                  time travel. We argue for a more liberal view, on the grounds
                  that it allows us to view mental time travel as an
                  evolutionarily continuous phenomenon and to recognize that
                  differences in the ways that organisms mentally time travel
                  might reflect different temporal representations, or
                  combinations thereof, that they employ. Our ultimate aim,
                  however, is to create a conceptual framework for further
                  discussion regarding what sorts of temporal representations
                  are required for mental time travel. This article is part of

                  contributors to behaviour, including factors in the external
                  world and our internal states. We provide a non-technical
                  conceptual overview of challenges and opportunities for causal
                  inference on human behaviour. The challenges include our
                  ambiguous causal language and thinking, statistical under- or
                  over-control, effect heterogeneity, interference, timescales
                  of effects and complex treatments. We explain how methods
                  optimized for addressing one of these challenges frequently
                  exacerbate other problems. We thus argue that clearly
                  specified research questions are key to improving causal
                  inference from data. We suggest a triangulation approach that
                  compares causal estimates from (quasi-)experimental research
                  with causal estimates generated from observational data and
                  theoretical assumptions. This approach allows a systematic

  abstract     = {Evoking simplicity in marketing communications has become
                  popular among marketing practitioners, but little is known
                  about its effects on consumers and firms. The current work
                  focuses on consumers’ perceptions of the simplicity or
                  complexity of brands and a previously overlooked consequence
                  of those perceptions. Results from six experiments and
                  analysis of a proprietary customer satisfaction dataset from
                  Consumer Reports (N = 147,600) show that when consumers think
                  brands are simple, they judge them to be less likely to
                  experience product or service failures. Although these lower
                  risk judgments could be positive for brands, they can also
                  lead consumers to punish simpler brands more in the event of
                  failures. Results also suggest that consumers’
                  simplicity/complexity perceptions reflect the dimensionality
                  of their mental representations of brands, and the
                  relationship between simplicity and lower risk is attenuated
                  when additional brand dimensionality is framed in terms of
                  redundancy. The findings cast doubt on the degree to which
                  evoking simplicity is a uniformly positive marketing strategy
                  and encourage practitioners to more thoughtfully consider
                  simplicity's implications for consumer and firm welfare.},

                  is problematic in developing marketing knowledge, and in
                  impacting marketing practice effectively. The present article
                  discusses the importance of conducting within-person research
                  in marketing, alongside suggesting marketing constructs that
                  could benefit from within-person analyses. We provide details
                  on how to conceptualize within-person theories, and compare
                  them with the more common between-persons approach.
                  Furthermore, a set of important methodological considerations
                  and recommendations for designing within-person studies is

                  implications for, and effects on, brands and advertisers.
                  Increasingly, brands are creating digital models to showcase
                  clothing and accessories in a similar way to human models,
                  with AI used to customize various body types, ages, sizes, and
                  skin tones. However, little is known about how the
                  underrepresented consumers respond to a brand's intention to
                  use AI‐generated models to represent them. We explore this by
                  conducting four studies. We find evidence that a brand's
                  intention to use AI‐generated (vs. human) models negatively
                  affects brand attitude (study 1). We further investigate this
                  effect using two different underrepresented consumer groups:
                  LGBTQIA+ consumers (study 2) and consumers with disabilities
                  (study 3). We show the effect to be serially mediated by
                  consumers' perception of greater threat to their self‐identity
                  and a lower sense of belonging, subsequently having a negative
                  effect on brand attitude. Finally, we show that the perception
                  of a brand's motivation for representing diverse consumer
                  groups can attenuate these negative effects (study 4).
                  Specifically, when consumers believe a brand is intrinsically
                  motivated to use AI‐generated diversity representations, they
                  report a significantly lower social identity threat which in
                  turn is associated with a significantly higher sense of
                  belonging to the brand. Our research findings suggest that a
                  brand's well‐meaning intentions to represent diversity can in
                  fact have negative effects on the very consumers whom a brand
                  is trying to attract. While catering to diversity is of
                  critical importance, our results indicate that brand managers
                  should exercise caution when using AI to appeal to diverse
                  groups of potential consumers.},

                  beginning to be more understood. Because of its prospective
                  and inferential functions, we hypothesized that it might be
                  required specifically when decisions involve the evaluation of
                  uncertain values. A group of individuals with autoimmune
                  limbic encephalitis—a condition known to focally affect the
                  hippocampus—were tested on how they evaluate reward against
                  uncertainty compared to reward against another key attribute:
                  physical effort. Across four experiments requiring
                  participants to make trade-offs between reward, uncertainty
                  and effort, patients with acute limbic encephalitis
                  demonstrated blunted sensitivity to reward and effort whenever
                  uncertainty was considered, despite demonstrating intact
                  uncertainty sensitivity. By contrast, the valuation of these
                  two attributes (reward and effort) was intact on
                  uncertainty-free tasks. Reduced sensitivity to changes in

                  hierarchy information is crucial for adapting to social
                  contexts. Here, we adopted fast periodic visual stimulation
                  (FPVS) with electroencephalography (EEG) to assess the neural
                  responses to social hierarchy during social competition and
                  cooperation, respectively. Participants first learned
                  hierarchical faces from a competitive game versus a
                  cooperative game. We then sequentially presented the learned
                  hierarchical faces with a specific frequency in a set of
                  faces. Results showed that participants rated the inferior
                  player as lower in the social hierarchy in the cooperative
                  context compared to the competitive context, indicating that
                  social context affects the judgment of others’ rank. Moreover,
                  higher neural responses to high and low-hierarchy faces versus
                  medium-hierarchy faces were observed, suggesting rapid
                  discrimination of social hierarchy from faces. Interestingly,
                  rank-specific neural responses were more pronounced in the

  abstract     = {Music appreciation is a complex process that involves
                  responses to surface-level structure, personal associations,
                  and source sensitivity. Source sensitivity is an understanding
                  of the context in which a musical artifact was created. This
                  article joins a growing body of literature in which program
                  notes are manipulated to highlight the importance of source
                  sensitivity, shifting the focus onto cultural context. Two
                  hundred eighty-four participants formed six groups in a 2×3
                  between-subjects design. Western and non-Western participants
                  (ethnicity condition) listened to an original percussion
                  composition accompanied by a short text providing a Western,
                  Indian, or blended cultural context (cultural context
                  condition). They then evaluated the music across a range of
                  measures. Exploratory factor analysis revealed two factors of
                  appreciation: Hedonic and Eudaimonic. Results revealed
                  significant ethnicity–cultural context interactions for both.
                  In the Indian context, Western participants exhibited high
                  appreciation, whereas non-Western listeners exhibited low
                  appreciation. Among non-Westerners, appreciation was highest
                  in the blended context. Our results demonstrate an association
                  between cultural source information and music appreciation. We
                  propose that Western participants experience a proteophilic
                  response to Indian music due to their secure status as members
                  of a dominant social group. Non-Western participants, however,
                  require a neutralizing Western context to similarly appreciate
                  Indian music content.},

                  traits are linked to both creative benefits and disadvantages,
                  moderated by the autistic trait and the creative domain under

                  autistic traits and creative attributes (creative personality
                  traits, creative talent, creative artistic choices) in
                  children aged 10–14 years. Autistic traits were measured using
                  the Adolescent‐AQ, both globally (AQ‐Total) and for individual
                  subscales (AQ‐Attention to detail, AQ‐Imagination, and
                  “AQ‐Core”, i.e., combining AQ‐Social skills, AQ‐Attention
                  switching, AQ‐Communication). Using child and parent reports,
                  data from 149 children revealed an association between
                  autistic traits and creative personality traits (both positive

                  negatively predicted creative personality traits. At the same
                  time, AQ‐Imagination predicted lower creative attributes
                  across nearly all creative domains. Finally, and in contrast,

                  indicators of creative potential. Both have been embedded in
                  hierarchical intelligence models as part of the ability to
                  retrieve information from long‐term memory; an ability that is
                  often measured with indicators of retrieval fluency. Creative
                  fluency and retrieval fluency, both expressed by the count of
                  correct responses, are procedurally highly similar. This
                  raises the question how creative fluency and originality are
                  related with retrieval fluency and how both are predicted by
                  other cognitive abilities. In a multivariate study (N = 320),
                  we found that retrieval fluency is very strongly related with
                  creative fluency (r = .87) and substantially related with
                  originality (r = .59). A combined fluency factor still fitted
                  the data well. Cognitive abilities accounted for 63\% variance
                  in fluency and 47\% variance in originality. After controlling
                  for established cognitive abilities, latent variables for
                  fluency and originality were unrelated with one another. This
                  suggests that the procedural proximity of the ability to
                  fluently generate either information from long‐term memory or
                  ad‐hoc solutions to unusual tasks and the ability to come up
                  with original ideas needs reconsideration. Locating
                  originality below an overarching retrieval factor is

               up double binds for women. Our discussion focuses on three key
               sites of gender inequality: the workplace, work–family interface,
               and heterosexual relationships. We begin the chapter by
               introducing the stereotype content model and gender stereotype
               content. Next, drawing on system justification theory (Jost,
               Banaji, \& Nosek, 2004) and the backlash and stereotype
               maintenance model (Rudman, Moss-Racusin, Glick, \& Phelan, 2012),
               we consider how stereotypes can undermine targets, even leading
               individuals to behave in ways that confirm them. The body of the
               chapter is organized by sets of gendered expectations that pose
               barriers to women in each domain. Although across domains the
               dilemma for women is choosing between being liked or respected,
               context alters the boundaries and expressions of gendered rules.
               In the workplace, women struggle to claim resources without being
               seen as demanding; at the work–family interface, women contend
               with conflict between motherhood and ideal worker norms; and
               finally, in the bedroom, traditional sexual roles limit women’s
               ability to be sexually assertive without seeming dominant. With
               the recognition that much research in this area has been based on
               a White, heterosexual, middle-class perspective, throughout the
               chapter we have attempted to incorporate research on how
               intersections of gender and other social identities (e.g., race)
               alter women’s experiences of these challenges. (PsycInfo Database

                  evaluation, some groups of judges also rated the hypothetical
                  person on a list of bipolar traits. It appears that traits may
                  be central or peripheral, according to their fit in the
                  general configuration of traits. Altering a central trait in a
                  series changes the impression much more than altering a
                  peripheral trait. Interpretation of a single trait varies with
                  the context of other traits, thus denying the validity of
                  independent, additive traits in personality. The order of
                  listing of traits influences the impression formed from the

                  literature and is often a part of organizations’ mission
                  statements and objectives. It is seen by many commentators as
                  the key to long-term success, with Albrecht (1992, p 7)
                  arguing that “the only thing that matters in the new world of
                  quality is delivering customer value.” Despite this emphasis,
                  little research has addressed the value construct itself and
                  there is no well-accepted value measure, even in the retail
                  environment in which customers evaluate products before
                  purchase.The present research project describes the
                  development of a 19-item measure, PERVAL, that can be used to
                  assess customers’ perceptions of the value of a consumer
                  durable good at a brand level. The measure was developed for
                  use in a retail purchase situation to determine what
                  consumption values drive purchase attitude and behavior. Four
                  distinct, value dimensions emerged that were termed emotional,
                  social, quality/performance and price/value for money. The
                  reliability and validity of the scale was assessed in a
                  prepurchase situation, using exploratory and confirmatory
                  analyses. All four value dimensions were found to help
                  significantly in explaining attitudes and behavior. The scale
                  was also tested in a postpurchase situation and found to be
                  both reliable and valid in this context as well. The PERVAL
                  scale has a variety of potential applications and can serve as

                  investigated this question using listening to positive music
                  as a happiness-inducing activity. Study 1 showed that
                  participants assigned to try to boost their mood while
                  listening to 12 min of music reported higher positive mood
                  compared to participants who simply listened to music without
                  attempting to alter mood. However, this effect was qualified
                  by the predicted interaction: the music had to be positively
                  valenced (i.e. Copland, not Stravinsky). In Study 2,
                  participants who were instructed to intentionally try to
                  become happier (vs. not trying) reported higher increases in
                  subjective happiness after listening to positively valenced
                  music during five separate lab visits over a two-week period.
                  These studies demonstrate that listening to positive music may
                  be an effective way to improve happiness, particularly when it
                  is combined with an intention to become happier.},

  abstract     = {Uncertainty is a pervasive and important problem that has
                  attracted increasing attention in health care, given the
                  growing emphasis on evidence-based medicine, shared decision
                  making, and patient-centered care. However, our understanding
                  of this problem is limited, in part because of the absence of
                  a unified, coherent concept of uncertainty. There are multiple
                  meanings and varieties of uncertainty in health care that are
                  not often distinguished or acknowledged although each may have
                  unique effects or warrant different courses of action. The
                  literature on uncertainty in health care is thus fragmented,
                  and existing insights have been incompletely translated to
                  clinical practice. This article addresses this problem by
                  synthesizing diverse theoretical and empirical literature from
                  the fields of communication, decision science, engineering,
                  health services research, and psychology and developing a new
                  integrative conceptual taxonomy of uncertainty. A
                  3-dimensional taxonomy is proposed that characterizes
                  uncertainty in health care according to its fundamental
                  sources, issues, and locus. It is shown how this new taxonomy
                  facilitates an organized approach to the problem of
                  uncertainty in health care by clarifying its nature and
                  prognosis and suggesting appropriate strategies for its

                  quickly, contrary to the prediction of convent ional

                  thought to go hand-in-hand, it is possible for communication
                  to increase uncertainty if new information is inconsistent
                  with prior knowledge and undermines it. As an initial step
                  toward understanding the neglected side of uncertainty,
                  reports were gathered on types of events that increase
                  uncertainty in interpersonal relationships, their emotional
                  and cognitive impact, the uses of communication in dealing
                  with them, and their effects on the relationship. Results
                  indicated that almost everyone could remember experiencing
                  such an event, that there were six major types, and that the
                  impact on emotions, beliefs about the other person and the
                  relationship were very strong. The majority of relationships
                  were terminated or became less close as a result of the event
                  but many were unaffected or became closer, depending on
                  communicative, cognitive, and emotional variables. The
                  findings have important implications for studying
                  communication in relational dissolution and the accommodation
                  of social knowledge to inconsistent information.},

                  authenticity of algorithmic work, compared with human work.
                  People believe algorithmic work is less authentic than human
                  work because they believe it exhibits comparatively less moral
                  authenticity, or sincerity relevant to a specific category
                  (Experiments 1 and 2). However, people do not distinguish
                  between human and algorithmic work when it comes to type
                  authenticity, or accuracy when it comes to representing a
                  specific category. Because of these authenticity attributions,
                  people also believe algorithms’ characteristically moral
                  decisions are relatively less ethical than identical human
                  decisions (Experiment 3). To address these perceptions,
                  organizations can increase algorithms’ seeming authenticity by
                  highlighting human involvement in their creation or training
                  processes (Experiment 4). I discuss implications given the

                  dimensions, even when they report it is indistinguishable from
                  human-made art, and even when they believe it was produced
                  collaboratively with a human. We also find that comparing
                  images labeled as human-made to images labeled as AI-made
                  increases perceptions of human creativity, an effect that can
                  be leveraged to increase the value of human effort. Results
                  are robust across six experiments (N = 2965) using a range of
                  human-made and AI-made stimuli and incorporating
                  representative samples of the US population. Finally, we
                  highlight conditions that strengthen effects as well as
                  dimensions where AI-devaluation effects are more pronounced.},

                  the ability to produce outputs traditionally considered

                  Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E), which automates humans'
                  artistic execution to generate digital artworks. Utilizing a
                  dataset of over 4 million artworks from more than 50,000
                  unique users, our research shows that over time, text-to-image
                  AI significantly enhances human creative productivity by 25\%
                  and increases the value as measured by the likelihood of
                  receiving a favorite per view by 50\%. While peak artwork
                  Content Novelty, defined as focal subject matter and
                  relations, increases over time, average Content Novelty
                  declines, suggesting an expanding but inefficient idea space.
                  Additionally, there is a consistent reduction in both peak and
                  average Visual Novelty, captured by pixel-level stylistic
                  elements. Importantly, AI-assisted artists who can
                  successfully explore more novel ideas, regardless of their
                  prior originality, may produce artworks that their peers
                  evaluate more favorably. Lastly, AI adoption decreased value

                  intelligence (AI) models capable of mimicking human artworks,
                  AI creations might soon replace products of human creativity,
                  although skeptics argue that this outcome is unlikely. One
                  possible reason this may be unlikely is that, independent of
                  the physical properties of art, we place great value on the
                  imbuement of the human experience in art. An interesting
                  question, then, is whether and why people might prefer
                  human-compared to AI-created artworks. To explore these
                  questions, we manipulated the purported creator of pieces of
                  art by randomly assigning a "Human-created" or "AI-created"
                  label to paintings actually created by AI, and then assessed
                  participants' judgements of the artworks across four rating
                  criteria (Liking, Beauty, Profundity, and Worth). Study 1
                  found increased positive judgements for human- compared to
                  AI-labelled art across all criteria. Study 2 aimed to
                  replicate and extend Study 1 with additional ratings (Emotion,
                  Story, Meaningful, Effort, and Time to create) intended to
                  elucidate why people more-positively appraise Human-labelled
                  artworks. The main findings from Study 1 were replicated, with
                  narrativity (Story) and perceived effort behind artworks
                  (Effort) moderating the label effects ("Human-created" vs.
                  "AI-created"), but only for the sensory-level judgements
                  (Liking, Beauty). Positive personal attitudes toward AI
                  moderated label effects for more-communicative judgements
                  (Profundity, Worth). These studies demonstrate that people
                  tend to be negatively biased against AI-created artworks
                  relative to purportedly human-created artwork, and suggest
                  that knowledge of human engagement in the artistic process
                  contributes positively to appraisals of art.},

                  the DNA sequences for regulatory elements of DNA, RNAs, and
                  proteins leads to heritable regulatory change, which specifies
                  new combinations of core components, operating in new amounts
                  and states at new times and places in the animal. These new
                  configurations of components comprise new traits. The number
                  and kinds of regulatory changes needed for viable phenotypic
                  variation are determined by the properties of the
                  developmental and physiological processes in which core
                  components serve, in particular by the processes' modularity,
                  robustness, adaptability, capacity to engage in weak
                  regulatory linkage, and exploratory behavior. These properties
                  reduce the number of regulatory changes needed to generate
                  viable selectable phenotypic variation, increase the variety
                  of regulatory targets, reduce the lethality of genetic change,
                  and increase the amount of genetic variation retained by a
                  population. By such reductions and increases, the conserved
                  core processes facilitate the generation of phenotypic
                  variation, which selection thereafter converts to evolutionary
                  and genetic change in the population. Thus, we call it a
                  theory of facilitated phenotypic variation.},

                  makers conceptualize uncertainty? How do decision makers cope
                  with uncertainty? Are there systematic relationships between
                  different conceptualizations of uncertainty and different
                  methods of coping? To answer these questions we analyzed 102
                  self-reports of decision-making under uncertainty with an
                  inclusive method of classifying conceptualizations of
                  uncertainty and coping mechanisms developed from the
                  decision-making literature. The results showed that decision
                  makers distinguished among three types of uncertainty:
                  inadequate understanding, incomplete information, and
                  undifferentiated alternatives. To these they applied five
                  strategies of coping: reducing uncertainty, assumption-based
                  reasoning, weighing pros and cons of competing alternatives,
                  suppressing uncertainty, and forestalling. Inadequate
                  understanding was primarily managed by reduction, incomplete
                  information was primarily managed by assumption-based
                  reasoning, and conflict among alternatives was primarily
                  managed by weighing pros and cons. Based on these results and

                  create this integrated environment, two important questions
                  emerge. Does a high level of internal integration lead to a
                  higher level of external integration? In the context of
                  product development, this study considers whether internal
                  integration in the form of concurrent engineering practices
                  affects the level of external integration as manifested by
                  customer integration, supplier product integration, and
                  supplier process integration. External integration, in turn,
                  may influence competitive capabilities, namely product
                  innovation performance and quality performance. Second, using
                  contingency theory, do certain contextual variables moderate
                  the linkages between integration strategy (external and
                  internal) and performance? Specifically, this study considers
                  whether uncertainty, equivocality, and platform development
                  strategy change the relationships among internal integration,
                  external integration, and competitive capabilities. Data
                  collected from 244 manufacturing firms across several
                  industries were used to test these research questions. The
                  results indicate that both internal and external integration
                  positively influence product innovation and quality and
                  ultimately, profitability. With respect to contingency
                  effects, the results indicate that equivocality moderates the

                  such innovative adoption. This study seeks to construe the
                  realistic thoughts raised by artists regarding the new revenue
                  opportunities arising from the adoption of blockchain in the
                  Korean music industry. This involves the disintermediation of
                  the obsolete music royalty distribution system and a new
                  revenue channel from the Non-fungible Token market. Based on
                  social representation theory and interviews with Korean
                  artists, this study found ambivalent perceptions towards the
                  adoption of blockchain in the music industry - hoping for new
                  possibilities while also perceiving the impracticality of such
                  innovation. Indeed, it may be too good to be true for artists

  abstract     = {Considerable work-family research has investigated the
                  gendered division of work and care. Gender differences in
                  leisure time have received much less attention from
                  work-family scholars, despite the potential importance of such
                  inequalities for women’s quality of life. Combining key
                  insights from the substantial gendered leisure studies
                  literature with work-family scholarship, the current study
                  examines cross-national variation in gender differences in
                  leisure quality. Using data on 23 countries from the 2007
                  International Social Survey Program, we expected that women’s
                  leisure quality would be lower than men’s, but the gender gap
                  would be smaller in countries with more gender egalitarian
                  attitudes and divisions of care (via de-familialisation and
                  paternity leave) and where women have more bargaining power.
                  Our results show that these country characteristics moderate
                  the association between gender and the extent to which free
                  time is used to relax and recover. In countries with
                  conservative gender norms, low levels of childcare coverage,
                  limited paternity leave and lower political power for women,
                  women’s leisure quality is lower than men’s. In more
                  egalitarian countries, the gender gap in leisure quality is
                  lower and in some cases, reversed. These results are in line
                  with findings from cross-national research on the gendered
                  division of labor and offer an important contribution to
                  understanding gender differences in leisure quality across
                  countries.},

  abstract     = {PurposeDrawing on the stereotype content model (SCM), the
                  authors investigate the stereotype content transfer (in terms
                  of warmth and competence) from country to brand and the
                  simultaneous impact of these two stereotypes on consumer
                  responses toward brands.Design/methodology/approachThe authors
                  test a structural equation model conceptualizing brand
                  stereotypes as full mediators between country stereotypes and
                  consumer outcomes. In addition, in a moderated mediation
                  analysis, the authors investigate the role of brand typicality
                  and utilitarianism/hedonism in potentially moderating the
                  country to brand stereotype content transfer.FindingsCountry
                  warmth and competence, respectively, impact brand warmth and
                  competence, thus confirming the hypothesized stereotype
                  content transfer. This transfer is found to be robust and not
                  contingent on brands' perceived typicality of their country of
                  origin. However, brands' utilitarian nature amplifies the
                  positive impact of country competence on brand competence.
                  Finally, brand stereotypes fully mediate the impact of country
                  stereotypes on consumers' brand attitudes and behavioral
                  intentions.Originality/valueThe authors provide the first
                  empirical attempt that (1) explicitly differentiates between
                  consumers' stereotypical perceptions of countries and
                  stereotypical perceptions of brands from these countries, (2)
                  empirically examines the transfer of stereotypical dimensions
                  of different targets (i.e. country to brand), (3) explores
                  boundary conditions for such transfer and (4) simultaneously
                  considers the impact of both kinds of stereotypes on
                  managerially relevant consumer outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Diversified purchases of consumers can help companies balance
                  sales and inventories, which is of great significance to
                  company profits. While existing research has explored the
                  internal factors and external factors that influence
                  consumers' variety-seeking behavior, little is known about the
                  impact of background music, an important environmental cue in
                  retail establishments, on consumer variety-seeking behavior.
                  The present research investigates the influence of background
                  music tempo on consumer variety-seeking behavior, along with
                  its underlying mechanism and boundary condition. Five
                  experiments revealed that background music tempo affects
                  consumers' variety-seeking behavior (Study 1a, 1b \& 4).
                  Specifically, fast-tempo background music increases consumers'
                  variety-seeking behavior (Study 1b). Arousal mediates the main
                  effect (Study 2), as fast-tempo background music increases
                  consumers' variety-seeking behavior by enhancing consumers'
                  arousal. Moreover, participants' familiarity with the
                  background music moderates the impact of background music
                  tempo on consumer variety-seeking behavior (Study 3). Only
                  when consumers have a high degree of familiarity with the
                  background music they listen to, the tempo of the background
                  music will have a significant impact on their variety-seeking
                  behavior. These findings provide important theoretical
                  contributions and management implications.},

                  understudied population who have yet to secure a place within
                  academia. Which effects promise higher scientific recognition
                  (i.e., citations) is therefore crucial for the high-stakes
                  decisions young researchers face. To capture these effects, we
                  introduce measurements for interdisciplinarity and novelty
                  that can be applied to a researcher's career. In contrast to
                  previous studies investigating research impact on the paper
                  level, hence, our paper focuses on a career perspective (i.e.,
                  the level of authors). To consider different disciplinary
                  cultures, we utilize a comprehensive dataset on U.S.
                  physicists (n = 4003) and psychologists (n = 4097), who
                  graduated between 2008 and 2012, and traced their publication

                  research impact in psychology. In both fields, physics and
                  psychology, early career researchers focusing on novel
                  combinations of existing knowledge are associated with higher
                  future impact. Taking some risks by deviating to a certain

                  negatively than in-groups, majorities, and familiar groups.
                  Previous research has argued that such intergroup biases may
                  be caused by the order in which people typically encounter
                  social groups. Groups that are relatively novel to perceivers
                  (e.g., out-groups, minorities) are primarily associated with
                  distinct attributes that differentiate them from familiar
                  groups. Because distinct attributes are typically negative,
                  attitudes toward novel groups are negatively biased. Five
                  experiments ( N = 2,615 adults) confirmed the generalizability
                  of the novel groups’ disadvantage to different aspects of
                  attitude formation (i.e., evaluations, memory, stereotyping),
                  to cases with more than two groups, and to cases in which
                  groups were majority/minority or in-groups/out-groups. Our
                  findings revealed a remarkably robust influence of learning
                  order in the formation of group attitudes, and they imply that
                  people often perceive novel groups more negatively than they
                  actually are.},

                  these constructs interact in the wild. Using naturalistic,
                  large-scale language produced on Twitter, we ask whether
                  increases in environmental uncertainty and associated aversive
                  emotional reactions can be captured by the millions of digital
                  traces of people sharing their thoughts online. Analyzing more
                  than 20 million tweets from more than 7.5 million unique
                  users, we find that uncertainty expressions peak when
                  environmental uncertainty is high. This effect, however, is
                  modulated by the type of trigger that increases uncertainty.
                  Pandemics (COVID-19 in 2020) and national U.S. elections
                  (2021) exhibit an increase in uncertainty language and
                  negative sentiment in the real world, illustrating the
                  well-documented relationship between uncertainty and aversive
                  emotional reactions acting in lockstep. In contrast, when
                  uncertain events involve a moral violation (i.e., the 2021
                  U.S. Capitol attack), specific negative emotions (i.e., anger,
                  fear, and moral outrage) sharply increase, while uncertainty
                  language abruptly decreases. This reveals that in the real
                  world, uncertainty and emotion have a more complex
                  relationship than originally assumed. (PsycInfo Database

                  to organic food consumption under the mediating role of
                  involvement as well as the moderating role of uncertainty.
                  Research data were collected from organic food consumers in
                  Taiwan via a questionnaire survey, eventually obtaining 457

                  styles (which feature rhythmic, upbeat, and electronic
                  attributes), whereas trait Openness was correlated with
                  stronger reactions to Sophisticated musical styles (which
                  feature complex and cerebral attributes often heard in
                  improvisational and instrumental music). The patterns of
                  correlations between musical preferences and gender
                  differences, ethnicity, and other sociodemographic metrics
                  were also largely invariant across countries. Together, these
                  findings strongly suggest that there are universal patterns in
                  preferences for Western music, providing a foundation on which
                  to develop and test hypotheses about the interactions between

  abstract     = {Music is a universal phenomenon that has existed in every
                  known culture around the world. It plays a prominent role in
                  society by shaping sociocultural interactions between groups
                  and individuals, and by influencing their emotional and
                  intellectual life. Here, we provide evidence for a new theory
                  on musical preferences. Across three studies we show that
                  people prefer the music of artists who have publicly
                  observable personalities ("personas") similar to their own
                  personality traits (the "self-congruity effect of music").
                  Study 1 (N = 6,279) and Study 2 (N = 75,296) show that the
                  public personality of artists correlates with the personality
                  of their listeners. Study 3 (N = 4,995) builds on this by
                  showing that the fit between the personality of the listener
                  and the artist predicts musical preferences incremental to the
                  fit for gender, age, and even the audio features of music. Our
                  findings are largely consistent across two methodological
                  approaches to operationalizing an artist's public personality:
                  (a) the public personality as reported by the artist's fans,
                  and (b) the public personality as predicted by machine
                  learning on the basis of the artist's lyrics. We discuss the
                  importance of the self-congruity effect of music in the
                  context of group-level process theories and adaptionist
                  accounts of music. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all

                  We describe a method for assessing personality using an
                  open-vocabulary analysis of language from social media. We
                  compiled the written language from 66,732 Facebook users and
                  their questionnaire-based self-reported Big Five personality
                  traits, and then we built a predictive model of personality
                  based on their language. We used this model to predict the 5
                  personality factors in a separate sample of 4,824 Facebook
                  users, examining (a) convergence with self-reports of
                  personality at the domain- and facet-level; (b) discriminant
                  validity between predictions of distinct traits; (c) agreement
                  with informant reports of personality; (d) patterns of
                  correlations with external criteria (e.g., number of friends,
                  political attitudes, impulsiveness); and (e) test-retest
                  reliability over 6-month intervals. Results indicated that
                  language-based assessments can constitute valid personality
                  measures: they agreed with self-reports and informant reports
                  of personality, added incremental validity over informant
                  reports, adequately discriminated between traits, exhibited
                  patterns of correlations with external criteria similar to
                  those found with self-reported personality, and were stable
                  over 6-month intervals. Analysis of predictive language can
                  provide rich portraits of the mental life associated with
                  traits. This approach can complement and extend traditional
                  methods, providing researchers with an additional measure that
                  can quickly and cheaply assess large groups of participants
                  with minimal burden.},

                  musical preferences and personality are linked, yet little is
                  known about other influences on preferences such as cognitive
                  styles. To address this gap, we investigated how individual
                  differences in musical preferences are explained by the
                  empathizing-systemizing (E-S) theory. Study 1 examined the
                  links between empathy and musical preferences across four
                  samples. By reporting their preferential reactions to musical
                  stimuli, samples 1 and 2 (Ns = 2,178 and 891) indicated their
                  preferences for music from 26 different genres, and samples 3
                  and 4 (Ns = 747 and 320) indicated their preferences for music
                  from only a single genre (rock or jazz). Results across
                  samples showed that empathy levels are linked to preferences
                  even within genres and account for significant proportions of
                  variance in preferences over and above personality traits for
                  various music-preference dimensions. Study 2 (N = 353)
                  replicated and extended these findings by investigating how
                  musical preferences are differentiated by E-S cognitive styles
                  (i.e., 'brain types'). Those who are type E (bias towards
                  empathizing) preferred music on the Mellow dimension
                  (R\&B/soul, adult contemporary, soft rock genres) compared to
                  type S (bias towards systemizing) who preferred music on the
                  Intense dimension (punk, heavy metal, and hard rock). Analyses
                  of fine-grained psychological and sonic attributes in the
                  music revealed that type E individuals preferred music that
                  featured low arousal (gentle, warm, and sensual attributes),
                  negative valence (depressing and sad), and emotional depth
                  (poetic, relaxing, and thoughtful), while type S preferred
                  music that featured high arousal (strong, tense, and
                  thrilling), and aspects of positive valence (animated) and
                  cerebral depth (complexity). The application of these findings
                  for clinicians, interventions, and those on the autism
                  spectrum (largely type S or extreme type S) are discussed.},

                  Rentfrow and Gosling (2003 , 2006 ) have helped guide the way
                  toward understanding the role of music in people's lives, and
                  the relationship between music preferences and personality.
                  The four music dimensions they established in their 2003 study
                  provide a broad-brush look at some of the relationships
                  between music preferences and personality. This study of 83
                  undergraduates at Guilford College in Greensboro, NC, used the
                  NEO-PI, rather than the Big Five Inventory, which allowed us
                  to examine the six facets that make up each of the Big Five
                  traits as well as those traits themselves, and it looked
                  separately at the music genres that make up the four music
                  dimensions identified by Rentfrow and Gosling (2003) . The
                  findings provide general support for Rentfrow and Gosling's
                  work, but they also demonstrate that the personality patterns
                  for the specific music genres differ considerably from one
                  another, even those that fall within the same broad music
                  dimensions. The Openness trait was by far the most robust of
                  the Big Five traits assessed by the NEO-PI, and preferences
                  for some music genres (e.g., folk, international music, and
                  rap/hip-hop) were far more revealing of personality than
                  others (e.g., classical, rock, and electronic).},

                  always focused purely on empathy. We report a new self-report
                  questionnaire, the Empathy Quotient (EQ), for use with adults
                  of normal intelligence. It contains 40 empathy items and 20
                  filler/control items. On each empathy item a person can score
                  2, 1, or 0, so the EQ has a maximum score of 80 and a minimum
                  of zero. In Study 1 we employed the EQ with n = 90 adults (65
                  males, 25 females) with Asperger Syndrome (AS) or
                  high-functioning autism (HFA), who are reported clinically to
                  have difficulties in empathy. The adults with AS/HFA scored
                  significantly lower on the EQ than n = 90 (65 males, 25
                  females) age-matched controls. Of the adults with AS/HFA, 81\%
                  scored equal to or fewer than 30 points out of 80, compared
                  with only 12\% of controls. In Study 2 we carried out a study
                  of n = 197 adults from a general population, to test for
                  previously reported sex differences (female superiority) in
                  empathy. This confirmed that women scored significantly higher
                  than men. The EQ reveals both a sex difference in empathy in
                  the general population and an empathy deficit in AS/HFA.},

                  theory to account for uncertainty reduction during

                  indicated that it provides a good fit to data provided by
                  students in the United States on their relationships (i.e.
                  acquaintance or friendships) with international students. It
                  is argued, however, that since the model is a straight-forward
                  extension of an interpersonal theory, it may only apply to
                  intercultural encounters where inter-group salience is low and

                  have devastating consequences for individuals and
                  organizations. Here we examine whether risk-taking affords
                  social-hierarchical benefits to risk-takers. Specifically, we
                  investigate how risk-taking influences perceived dominance,
                  prestige, and the willingness to endorse risk-takers'
                  leadership. Integrating insights from costly signaling theory
                  and the dominance/prestige framework of social rank, we
                  theorized that risk-taking increases leadership endorsement to
                  the degree that it fuels perceptions of prestige, but
                  decreases leadership endorsement to the degree that it fuels
                  perceptions of dominance. However, we also hypothesized that
                  risk-induced perceptions of dominance do translate into
                  leadership endorsement in competitive (rather than
                  cooperative) intergroup settings. We tested these hypotheses
                  in four studies involving different samples, methods, and
                  operationalizations. In Study 1, participants performed an
                  implicit association test (IAT) that revealed that people
                  associate risk with leader positions, and safety with follower
                  positions. Study 2 was a longitudinal field survey conducted
                  during the September 2019 Israeli elections, which showed that
                  voters' perceptions of politicians' risk-taking propensities
                  prior to the elections positively predicted perceived
                  dominance and prestige as well as voting behavior during the
                  elections. Finally, Studies 3 and 4 demonstrated that people
                  are willing to support risk-takers as leaders in the context
                  of competitive (as opposed to cooperative) intergroup
                  situations, because perceived dominance positively predicts
                  leadership endorsement in competitive (but not cooperative)
                  intergroup settings. We discuss implications for understanding
                  the social dynamics of organizational rank and the
                  perpetuation of risky behavior in organizations, politics, and
                  society at large. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all

                  inconsistent relationships between risk perception and
                  risk-taking. One aspect that has often been neglected in such
                  studies is the situational context in which risk behavior is
                  embedded: Even though a person may perceive a behavior as
                  risky, the social norms governing the situation may work as a
                  counteracting force, overriding the influence of risk
                  perception. Three food context studies are reported. In Study
                  1 (N = 200), we assess how norm strength varies across
                  different social situations, relate the variation in norm
                  strength to the social characteristics of the situation, and
                  identify situations with consistently low and high levels of
                  pressure to comply with the social norm. In Study 2 (N = 502),
                  we investigate how willingness to accept 15 different foods
                  that vary in terms of objective risk relates to perceived risk
                  in situations with low and high pressure to comply with a
                  social norm. In Study 3 (N = 1,200), we test how risk-taking
                  is jointly influenced by the perceived risk associated with
                  the products and the social norms governing the situations in
                  which the products are served. The results indicate that the
                  effects of risk perception and social norm are additive,
                  influencing risk-taking simultaneously but as counteracting
                  forces. Social norm had a slightly stronger absolute effect,
                  leading to a net effect of increased risk-taking. The
                  relationships were stable over different social situations and
                  food safety risks and did not disappear when detailed risk
                  information was presented.},

                  responses to AI recommendations in a gift giving context.
                  Through five studies, we found that social closeness between
                  the giver and recipient significantly affects the use of AI
                  gift recommendation tools, driven by two underlying
                  mechanisms: expected relational signaling and preference
                  matching. In addition to establishing these effects, this
                  research identifies relevant boundary conditions. Our findings
                  reveal that self‐oriented perfectionism increases preference
                  matching for gifts to distant friends, while revealing the
                  giver's identity boosts AI tool use for close friends by

                  hypothesized by previous literature, the last study reveals
                  that the SIS can predict status anxiety. The SIS can
                  contribute to research regarding important phenomena such as
                  the detrimental psychological effects of income inequality.},

                  goal specificity (vague vs. specific). Two laboratory-based
                  experiments were performed. Experiment 1 reveals that, after
                  receiving positively valenced feedback, participants who focus
                  on accumulated progress show larger boosts in persistence than
                  participants who focus on remaining progress. In contrast,
                  after receiving negatively valenced feedback, participants who
                  focus on remaining progress show larger boosts in persistence
                  than participants who focus on accumulated progress.
                  Experiment 2 extends the scope of the paper from understanding
                  the effects of progress monitoring on goal striving to the
                  effects goal specificity on goal striving. Experiment 2 shows
                  that after receiving negatively valenced feedback,
                  participants asked to consider specific goals (and so likely

                  participants asked to consider vague goals (and so likely

                  analytical results for finite populations are rare, and those
                  that exist apply to situations in which strategy sets are
                  discrete. We rigorously analyse a standard model for the
                  evolution of cooperation (the multi-player continuous-strategy
                  snowdrift game) and show that in many situations in which
                  there is a cooperative evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) if

                  influencers. In contrast, some recent studies find targeting

                  follower base of the seeding target to the focal content
                  creator. The authors propose accelerating natural triadic

  abstract     = {Humans regularly solve complex problems in cooperative teams.
                  A wide range of mechanisms have been identified that improve
                  the quality of solutions achieved by those teams on reaching
                  consensus. We argue that many of these mechanisms work via
                  increasing the transient diversity of solutions while the
                  group attempts to reach a consensus. These mechanisms can
                  operate at the level of individual psychology (e.g.,
                  behavioral inertia), interpersonal communication (e.g.,
                  transmission noise), or group structure (e.g., sparse social
                  networks). Transient diversity can be increased by widening
                  the search space of possible solutions or by slowing the
                  diffusion of information and delaying consensus. All of these
                  mechanisms increase the quality of the solution at the cost of
                  increased time to reach it. We review specific mechanisms that
                  facilitate transient diversity and synthesize evidence from
                  both empirical studies and diverse formal models—including
                  multiarmed bandits, NK landscapes, cumulative-innovation
                  models, and evolutionary-transmission models. Apparent
                  exceptions to this principle occur primarily when problems are
                  sufficiently simple that they can be solved by mere trial and
                  error or when the incentives of team members are

                  rival teams, and developing effective responses, lies at the
                  heart of modern football. However, doing so algorithmically
                  remains an open research challenge. To address this unmet
                  need, we propose TacticAI, an AI football tactics assistant
                  developed and evaluated in close collaboration with domain
                  experts from Liverpool FC. We focus on analysing corner kicks,
                  as they offer coaches the most direct opportunities for
                  interventions and improvements. TacticAI incorporates both a
                  predictive and a generative component, allowing the coaches to
                  effectively sample and explore alternative player setups for
                  each corner kick routine and to select those with the highest
                  predicted likelihood of success. We validate TacticAI on a
                  number of relevant benchmark tasks: predicting receivers and
                  shot attempts and recommending player position adjustments.
                  The utility of TacticAI is validated by a qualitative study
                  conducted with football domain experts at Liverpool FC. We
                  show that TacticAI’s model suggestions are not only
                  indistinguishable from real tactics, but also favoured over
                  existing tactics 90\% of the time, and that TacticAI offers an
                  effective corner kick retrieval system. TacticAI achieves
                  these results despite the limited availability of
                  gold-standard data, achieving data efficiency through
                  geometric deep learning.},

                  tuned. The popular narrative about digital advertising is that

                  that digital platforms’ targeted advertising is more
                  productively understood as tuned advertising, where
                  algorithmic models optimize the resonance between ads and
                  consumers in a continuous rhythmic flow of images, videos, and
                  text. We develop the concept of tuned advertising by drawing
                  on a study conducted with 204 young people from the Australian
                  state of Victoria, where they sent us over 5,169 screenshots
                  of alcohol, gambling, and unhealthy food ads they saw in their
                  digital feeds. We identify five different “vibes” in the
                  collections of ads they sent us that reflect different
                  subjectivities and practices of consumption. We argue that
                  digital platforms create a mode of advertising organized

                  of homophilic behaviors—where individuals prefer to associate
                  with others like themselves—on Twitter, particularly focusing
                  on how these behaviors vary across different political
                  affiliations. While a general increase in homophily is a
                  well-documented phenomenon in social networks, its expression
                  within the diverse political contexts on Twitter remains
                  underexplored. This study seeks to understand how political
                  alignment influences homophily and its possible role in
                  reinforcing extreme viewpoints. In particular, the research
                  examines the patterns of interaction within political
                  communities on French Twitter, delineating between right-wing,
                  left-wing, and centrist groups. The findings reveal a
                  significant pattern: right-wing groups demonstrate a marked
                  increase in homophily over time, suggesting a stronger
                  predilection for in-group interaction when compared with their
                  centrist and left-wing counterparts. In addition, the study

                  analyzing the social connections within these clusters, the
                  study offers a detailed perspective on the dynamics of
                  political homophily on Twitter and how it evolves, informing

                  investigates the value of these tests in
                  decisions‐from‐experience (i.e., multi‐trial repeated choice)
                  tasks. In five studies (Ntotal = 1519), we comprehensively
                  compared the behavior of attentive and inattentive
                  participants (i.e., those who passed or failed a simple
                  attention check) among online participants; and also compared
                  those results to the results of lab studies reported
                  elsewhere. We found meaningful differences between the
                  behavior of attentive and inattentive participants even at the
                  first trial. Overall, attentive participants were more likely
                  to notice less‐obvious average values of the different
                  alternatives, while inattentive participants exhibited higher
                  sensitivity to typical outcomes. The findings show that even
                  one simple attention test is sufficient to differentiate
                  between attentive and inattentive participants in repetitive
                  tasks. Importantly, our results fully replicated three
                  previously run lab studies among attentive participants, but
                  not inattentive ones. This finding highlights the importance
                  of using attention tests to avoid spurious conclusions.},

                  on these accounts, we investigate whether creativity builds on
                  our capacity to forage in space (“creativity as strategic
                  foraging”). We report systematic connections between specific
                  forms of creative thinking—divergent and convergent—and
                  corresponding strategies for searching in space. U.S. American
                  adults completed two tasks designed to measure creativity.
                  Before each creativity trial, participants completed an
                  unrelated search of a city map. Between subjects, we
                  manipulated the search pattern, with some participants seeking
                  multiple, dispersed spatial locations and others repeatedly
                  converging on the same location. Participants who searched
                  divergently in space were better at divergent thinking but
                  worse at convergent thinking; this pattern reversed for

                  Here, participants joined a fictive online game-playing
                  community and interacted with its purported members, who
                  varied in terms of their trustworthiness and apparent

  abstract     = {AbstractTheories in motivation science, and in psychological
                  science more generally, are in a state of fragmentation that
                  impedes development of a robust body of knowledge.
                  Furthermore, fragmentation hinders communication among
                  scientists, with practitioners, and with policymakers and the
                  public. Theoretical integration is needed to overcome this
                  situation. In this commentary, I first provide an overview of
                  the integrative frameworks presented in this collection of
                  articles. Based on this overview, I discuss if and when we
                  should integrate theories. Several non-trivial conditions need
                  to be met for integration, including convergence of phenomena,
                  constructs, and theoretical propositions. Next, I address
                  strategies for integration, including rules for merging
                  constructs and ways to integrate propositions. I also discuss
                  how the generation of integrative frameworks, if not
                  successfully enacted, can paradoxically lead to further
                  proliferation rather than a reduction of theories. In
                  contrast, successful integration reduces redundancy and
                  simplifies the conceptual space used to describe, explain, or
                  predict a set of phenomena. Successful integration may require
                  not only theoretical work but also empirical validation,
                  strategic efforts in the scientific community, and change of
                  institutional policies. In conclusion, I argue that
                  within-discipline integration alone is not sufficient to
                  overcome the current theoretical stagnation in the field.
                  Attention to advances in neighboring disciplines,
                  formalization of models of motivation, and theoretical
                  differentiation to consider the specificity of constructs,
                  populations, and contexts are needed as well.},

                  engaged with marketing‐generated stories, from watching an
                  influencer detail her adventures abroad or a commercial about
                  a military service member who makes it home just in time for
                  the holidays. When consumers become so engaged with a story
                  that they begin to connect with the story characters and
                  imagine what will happen next, they experience a process known
                  as narrative transportation, which has significant positive
                  outcomes for marketers. Given the value that narrative
                  transportation provides to marketers, we conduct a systematic
                  literature review to both synthesize and provide direction on
                  the literature of narrative transportation. From our analysis
                  of 95 peer‐reviewed articles, we identify relevant theoretical
                  foundations and concepts (antecedents, outcomes, and
                  moderators) employed in these articles. Using these results as
                  our foundation, we detail how narrative transportation has
                  evolved in terms of both the presentation of the story and the
                  antecedents that affect narrative transportation. Further, we
                  present a conceptual model that will represent the next
                  iteration of the narrative transportation framework and
                  suggest avenues for future research. In doing so, we enable
                  researchers to continue the exploration of the narrative
                  transportation construct.},

                  proliferation of misinformation, consumers are becoming
                  increasingly more skeptical about the brands they purchase.
                  Transparency is often hailed as a strategic imperative to
                  reassure consumers and increase brand trust; however, its
                  deployment can be complex. With additional transparency,
                  consumers may become overloaded with information, and the
                  brand may be exposed to unwanted external scrutiny.
                  Consequently, before disclosing strategically sensitive
                  information, brands need more insight into how increasing
                  transparency might translate into strategically desirable
                  consumers' brand evaluations. Addressing this need, we examine
                  how transparency initiatives translate into consumers'
                  evaluation of brands by delineating the dimensions of the
                  perceived brand transparency construct, namely, observability,
                  comprehensibility, and intentionality. Next, we use this
                  conceptualization to develop and validate a scale to measure
                  perceived brand transparency. We close with a brand
                  transparency research agenda, as well as practical guidance
                  for managers considering investing in strategic transparency
                  initiatives.},

                  temperament, but the nature of this link (and, hence, the
                  possible underpinning mechanisms) are poorly understood. This
                  study focusses primarily on people with synaesthesia who have
                  visual experiences, including color, that are induced by
                  music. We determine how this impacts their musical preferences
                  and musical sophistication using previously validated
                  self-report measures and contrast them against
                  non-synaesthetes and synaesthetes with non-musical types. Our
                  data show that people with music-color synaesthesia gravitate
                  toward certain genres (e.g., Reflective and Complex) and show
                  more active engagement with music relative to controls and
                  other synaesthetes. However, synaesthesia as a whole is also
                  linked to greater musical sophistication (e.g., perceptual
                  abilities). A second study examines in detail the nature of
                  associations from musical notes to colors in synaesthetes
                  relative to non-synaesthetes. Synaesthetes have a distinctive
                  way of associating colors with notes: They are more consistent
                  over time, show a more sensitive pitch-luminance
                  correspondence, and have a distinctive color palette (e.g.,
                  more browns, fewer greens). These indicative features can be
                  used to determine the presence of this form of synaesthesia.},

                  The present study aimed to gain further insight into how music
                  influences emotions, investigating whether the lyrics or the
                  melody of a sad piece of non-classical music had a greater
                  influence on mood. The researchers presented a sample of 251
                  participants with isolated melody, isolated lyrics, and the
                  original version of a sad pop-ballad in turn, measuring the
                  influence of each on mood using the Brief Mood Introspection
                  Scale (BMIS). A one-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed that
                  all versions of the song significantly reduced mood scores
                  from baseline, with the isolated lyrics and original version
                  of the song reducing mood to a greater magnitude than the
                  melody. The results suggested that both the lyrics and melody
                  of the music influenced mood, though the lyrics appeared to do
                  so to a greater extent. Furthermore, a thematic analysis of
                  open-response questions provided preliminary evidence that the
                  semantic content of lyrics was more influential on mood than
                  the vocal expression of lyrics. Future research should aim to
                  replicate these findings, using both positively and negatively
                  emotionally valenced musical stimuli.},

                  decisions that influence firms' performance. Some decision
                  tasks are decomposable and can be broken down into smaller
                  parts (e.g., pricing new products). Others are
                  non‐decomposable and are challenging to break down (e.g.,
                  selecting creative work for advertising campaigns). The
                  literature remains divided on whether expertise aids
                  decision‐makers in addressing these different decision tasks,
                  as well as how different decision‐making processes (critical
                  analysis, intuition, introspection) improve decision‐makers'
                  performance when they face these tasks. Using experiments with
                  comparative samples of senior marketing managers (experts) and
                  general public participants (non‐experts), we test whether
                  expertise provides advantages when making decisions. Our
                  results suggest that experts perform better than the general
                  public with decomposable decision tasks, though not with
                  non‐decomposable decision tasks. Furthermore, decision‐makers
                  who rely on critical analysis perform better compared to

                  decision process is less important with non‐decomposable
                  decision tasks. These findings provide insight into the

                  address this issue by articulating alternative approaches to
                  theory that include formal modeling, paradigm elaboration,
                  problem solving, and theory emergence from observations.
                  Knowledge about these different approaches will, we believe,
                  help ameliorate disagreement and incomprehension across the
                  research tribes that dominate social science and business
                  school research. Each approach requires different assumptions
                  about truth and the representation of reality. We outline each
                  approach, provide examples, and a short critique. We suggest
                  that what may seem mundane to the critical realist may be
                  eye-opening to the pragmatist who directs attention to
                  practitioners. For the scholar immersed within the walls of a
                  paradigm, a set of stylized facts may challenge and inspire.
                  The secret to innovative theory contributions is to synthesize
                  ideas from the different tribes to use within your own focused
                  research program.},

  abstract     = {AbstractResearch in the general population has shown that
                  nostalgia is associated with greater wellbeing through
                  increased authenticity. It is well documented that autistic
                  versus non-autistic individuals experience reduced wellbeing.
                  This is the first study to explore nostalgia in autistic
                  people and whether nostalgia might support the wellbeing of
                  autistic people in the same way as non-autistic. This study
                  had two aims: (i) to explore the autistic experience of
                  nostalgia (proneness, triggers of nostalgia, related affect)
                  and (ii) to examine the interrelationships at trait level
                  between nostalgia, authenticity and wellbeing in autistic and
                  non-autistic young adults. Participants (n = 230) completed an
                  online questionnaire and reported about their nostalgic
                  experiences, wellbeing, authenticity and autistic traits.
                  Participants also wrote about either a nostalgic oran ordinary
                  memory and rated how happy they felt after reflecting on the
                  memory. With regards to the interrelationships at trait level
                  within the whole cohort, nostalgia was not associated with
                  increased authenticity or wellbeing. In contrast, authenticity
                  was associated with increased wellbeing. However, nostalgia
                  was not associated with greater wellbeing through increased
                  authenticity. Differences in these interrelationships between
                  autistic and non-autistic individuals are also discussed. The
                  autistic experience of nostalgia was similar to the
                  non-autistic, with the exception that autistic participants
                  were less prone to nostalgia. At state level, findings also
                  suggested that reflecting on nostalgic memories may boost
                  positive affect in autistic as well as non-autistic
                  individuals. This study may have implications for boosting
                  wellbeing in autistic people.},

                  management literature in recent years. Yet, with more than 100
                  scholarly papers published on the concept to date, it has
                  developed into a fragmented area of research with a diversity
                  of definitions and conceptual boundaries. This paper posits
                  that this heterogeneity of extant research impedes theoretical
                  and empirical advancement. To strengthen the foundation for
                  future work, we review the extant literature and offer an
                  integrative model of personal branding. Through our systematic
                  literature review we identify the key attributes of the
                  construct, establish its clarity by comparing it with similar
                  concepts in its nomological network, and suggest the
                  definitions of personal branding and personal brand based on
                  the reviewed literature. Further, we propose a theoretical
                  model of personal branding summarizing the findings from the
                  reviewed papers. The proposed model outlines the trends
                  conducive to personal branding, as well as its drivers,
                  processes, and outcomes. Finally, we discuss ethical
                  implications of personal branding for both scholarly work and
                  practice. In conclusion, we outline a further research agenda
                  for studying personal branding as a critical career and
                  organizational behavior activity in contemporary working

                  priority, current academic practices do not fully support this
                  goal. A research manuscript’s likely influence is difficult to
                  evaluate prior to publication, and audiences differ in their
                  understandings of what “impact” means. This article develops a
                  set of criteria for assessing and enhancing a publication’s
                  impact potential. An article is argued to have greater
                  influence if it changes many stakeholders’ understandings or
                  behaviors on a relevant matter; and makes its message
                  accessible by offering simple and clear findings and
                  translating them into actionable implications. These drivers
                  are operationalized as a checklist of criteria for authors,
                  reviewers, and research supervisors who wish to evaluate and
                  enhance a manuscript’s potential impact. This article invites

                  factor for career success. Despite the growing literature on
                  topics associated with personal brands, the conceptualization
                  and measurement of personal brand equity (PBE) have received
                  little attention. By drawing upon and integrating the
                  marketing and careers literatures on branding, we
                  reconceptualized the definition of PBE and delineated its
                  dimensions and conceptual boundaries. Furthermore, we
                  developed a 12‐item scale to measure PBE. Among seven
                  different samples (total N = 3,273), including two samples of
                  employees, this study tested the construct and
                  criterion‐related validity of the PBE scale. First,
                  exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a
                  three‐dimensional structure of PBE (brand appeal, brand
                  differentiation, and brand recognition). In two samples, the
                  convergent and discriminant validity of the PBE scale was
                  established. Finally, this study showed that PBE predicts
                  perceived employability, career success, and job performance.
                  The PBE scale offers new opportunities to understand and
                  measure career behaviors by considering individuals’ personal
                  brand positioning.},

                  theoretically grounded, cross-cultural, cross-groups
                  similarities and one difference across 10 non-US nations.
                  Seven European (individualist) and three East Asian
                  (collectivist) nations (N=1,028) support three hypothesized
                  cross-cultural similarities: (a) perceived warmth and
                  competence reliably differentiate societal group stereotypes;
                  (b) many out-groups receive ambivalent stereotypes (high on
                  one dimension; low on the other); and (c) high status groups
                  stereotypically are competent, whereas competitive groups
                  stereotypically lack warmth. Data uncover one consequential
                  cross-cultural difference: (d) the more collectivist cultures
                  do not locate reference groups (in-groups and societal
                  prototype groups) in the most positive cluster
                  (high-competence/high-warmth), unlike individualist cultures.
                  This demonstrates out-group derogation without obvious
                  reference-group favouritism. The SCM can serve as a
                  pancultural tool for predicting group stereotypes from
                  structural relations with other groups in society, and
                  comparing across societies.},

                  STP), and actions. At the marketing research stage, mechanical
                  AI can be used for data collection, thinking AI for market

                  scant research has systematically consolidated and extended
                  knowledge on social media marketing strategies (SMMSs). To
                  fill this research gap, we first define SMMS, using social
                  media and marketing strategy dimensions. This is followed by a
                  conceptualization of the developmental process of SMMSs, which
                  comprises four major components, namely drivers, inputs,
                  throughputs, and outputs. Next, we propose a taxonomy that
                  classifies SMMSs into four types according to their strategic
                  maturity level: social commerce strategy, social content
                  strategy, social monitoring strategy, and social CRM strategy.
                  We subsequently validate this taxonomy of SMMSs using
                  information derived from prior empirical studies, as well with
                  data collected from in-depth interviews and a quantitive

                  theories in marketing. The extensive marketing literature
                  documents consumers’ nonrational behavior even though
                  behavioral biases might not always be consistently termed or
                  formally described. In this review, we identify and synthesize
                  empirical research on behavioral biases in marketing. We
                  document the key findings according to three classes of
                  deviations (i.e., nonstandard preferences, nonstandard
                  beliefs, and nonstandard decision making) and the four phases
                  of consumer purchase decision making (i.e., need recognition,
                  pre-purchase, purchase, and post-purchase). Our organizing
                  framework allows us to (1) synthesize instructive marketing
                  papers in a concise and meaningful manner and (2) identify
                  connections and differences within and across categories in
                  both dimensions. In our review, we discuss specific
                  implications for management and avenues for future research.},

  abstract     = {Purpose Brand managers can choose among two fundamentally
                  different brand positioning strategies. One is a broad brand
                  strategy, focusing on many favorable brand associations. The
                  other is a narrow brand strategy, focusing on just a few and
                  thus more mentally accessible associations. Building on
                  associative memory theory, this paper aims to examine which of
                  these brand positioning strategies performs better under
                  dynamic market conditions. Design/methodology/approach Three
                  experiments test the effect of brand positioning strategy on
                  memory accessibility and competitive brand performance. Study
                  1 tests how brand strategy (broad vs narrow) affects defensive
                  brand performance. Study 2 tests how broad vs narrow brands
                  perform differently in a brand extension scenario (offensive
                  brand performance). Study 3 uses real brands and
                  situation-based attributes as stimuli in a defensive scenario.
                  Findings The results show that a narrow brand positioning
                  strategy leads to a competitive advantage. Narrow brands with
                  fewer and more accessible associations resist new competitors
                  more easily and have higher brand extension acceptance than do
                  broad brands. Research limitations/implications The study
                  shows how to use accessibility as evidence of associative
                  strength and test how accessibility influences competitive
                  brand performance in a controlled experimental context.
                  Practical implications Brand managers would benefit from a
                  narrow brand positioning strategy in accordance with the
                  unique selling proposition (USP) school of thought used by
                  many marketing practitioners. Originality/value The paper
                  demonstrates that narrow brand positioning performs better
                  than broad brand positioning in dynamic markets, and to the
                  knowledge is the first to do so.},

                  necessities is characterized by complexity, laden with
                  idiosyncratic consumer experiences, and driven by personally
                  relevant historical developments. This study pushes the
                  theoretical boundaries of understanding consumer necessities
                  by reaching beyond the classification of products into
                  traditional dichotomies such as necessity-luxury and
                  need-want. It focuses on how consumers experience and recount
                  emotion-laden events in their lives whereby certain products
                  move to being perceived as necessities over time. An analysis
                  of narratives reveals that product necessitation encompasses
                  five stages: familiarization, transformation in the form of
                  redemption or contamination, memorialization, (re)integration

                  luxuries to become thought of as necessities. Although the
                  luxury/necessity distinction is central to the fields of
                  marketing and economics, little research has examined the
                  perception of necessity as a psychological phenomenon. Three
                  studies examined the relationship of the perceived necessity
                  of a variety of consumer goods to goals, values, and
                  insecurity. In Study 1, the number of goods considered
                  necessities as opposed to luxuries correlated negatively with
                  intrinsic and positively with extrinsic goal pursuit. In Study
                  2, this pattern generalized to the distinction between needs
                  and wants, the extent to which participants reported needing
                  their possessions, and to materialistic values. In Study 3,
                  the perception of necessity mediated the relationship between
                  anxious attachment and materialism, suggesting that needing
                  consumer products has in part a basis in interpersonal
                  insecurity. In turn, it may facilitate materialistic
                  consumption.},

                  and resonance of scientific articles is essential. Here, we
                  offer 10 recommendations to amplify the discoverability of
                  studies in search engines and databases. Particularly, we
                  argue that the strategic use and placement of key terms in the
                  title, abstract and keyword sections can boost indexing and
                  appeal. By surveying 230 journals in ecology and evolutionary
                  biology, we found that current author guidelines may
                  unintentionally limit article findability. Our survey of 5323
                  studies revealed that authors frequently exhaust abstract word
                  limits—particularly those capped under 250 words. This
                  suggests that current guidelines may be overly restrictive and
                  not optimized to increase the dissemination and
                  discoverability of digital publications. Additionally, 92\% of
                  studies used redundant keywords in the title or abstract,
                  undermining optimal indexing in databases. We encourage
                  adopting structured abstracts to maximize the incorporation of
                  key terms in titles, abstracts and keywords. In addition, we
                  encourage the relaxation of abstract and keyword limitations
                  in journals with strict guidelines, and the inclusion of
                  multilingual abstracts to broaden global accessibility. These
                  recommendations to editors are designed to improve article
                  engagement and facilitate evidence synthesis, thereby aligning
                  scientific publishing with the modern needs of academic

                  money on experiences: fostering social connection. Consumers
                  reported feeling more kinship with someone who had made a
                  similar experiential purchase than someone who had made a
                  similar material purchase—a result tied to the greater
                  centrality of experiences to one's identity. This greater
                  sense of connection that experiences provide applied even when
                  someone else had made a similar, but superior purchase.
                  Participants also reported feeling more connected to others in
                  general, not just those who have made the same purchase, when

                  system and to examine if any traces of Korean traditional
                  Pansori are found in K‐pop. Innovation refers to successful
                  implementation of creative ideas, and creative ideas without
                  successful implementation are of no use in the business
                  sector. A conceptual framework of the K‐pop system, developed
                  by the author, consists of enabling people, contents, system
                  processes, and environments. This study identified eight
                  innovative aspects of K‐pop, which include manufacturing K‐pop
                  stars using a specific formula; providing government
                  leadership for K‐pop export; using well‐balanced copyrights to
                  encourage K‐pop fans' social media sharing of their copycat
                  versions; and embracing culturally hybrid K‐pop music styles
                  for global markets. K‐pop's possible links with Pansori are
                  found in K‐pop singers' Grit, similar to Pansori singers'
                  Gongryeok; and female K‐pop idols willing to take personal
                  sacrifices of “no dating” and “curfews,” resembling Pansori
                  singers' “punishing effort.” Confucian influence on K‐pop is
                  traced in South Korea's top‐down approaches by the government
                  and music industries, and gender inequality imposed on female

                  profiles; curiosity is often associated with positive
                  affective responses to uncertainty and improved learning
                  outcomes, whereas IU is associated with negative affective
                  responses and anxiety. Curiosity and IU have not previously
                  been examined together in children but may both play an
                  important role in understanding how children respond to
                  uncertainty. Our research aimed to examine how individual
                  differences in parent-reported curiosity and IU were
                  associated with behavioural and emotional responses to
                  uncertainty. Children aged 8 to 12 ( n = 133) completed a game
                  in which they were presented with an array of buttons on the
                  screen that, when clicked, played neutral or aversive sounds.
                  Children pressed buttons (information seeking) and rated their
                  emotions and worry under conditions of high and low
                  uncertainty. Facial expressions were also monitored for
                  affective responses. Analyses revealed that children sought
                  more information under high uncertainty than low uncertainty
                  trials and that more curious children reported feeling
                  happier. Contrary to expectations, IU and curiosity were not
                  related to the number of buttons children pressed, nor to
                  their self-reported emotion or worry. However, exploratory
                  analyses suggest that children who are high in IU may engage
                  in more information seeking that reflects checking or
                  safety-seeking than those who are low in IU. In addition, our
                  findings suggest that there may be age-related change in the
                  effects of IU on worry, with IU more strongly related to worry
                  in uncertain situations for older children than younger
                  children.},

                  phenomenon of Avenger Philanthropy. This manifests when people
                  make individual monetary donations to nonprofit organizations
                  (NPOs) to achieve a collective sense of moral grandstanding,
                  usually underpinned by humor. For the first time, the paper
                  makes sense of this phenomenon theoretically through drawing
                  on a wide range of literature including gift giving, game
                  theory and consumer psychology, and as a result, identifies
                  seven distinctive hallmarks. The paper maps the importance of
                  public expression of personal values, amplified through social
                  media, together with risks for the NPO that benefits from the
                  donations. Emotion underpins the giving behavior, both moral
                  outrage and humor. This investigation contributes to the gift

                  ideas as a desirable goal, and yet, creative ideas are
                  frequently rejected. Creativity researchers have often
                  suggested that creative ideas are rejected because they are
                  perceived as riskier due to their inherent novelty or
                  originality. Although this assumption is prevalent, we are
                  unaware of any empirical research directly examining the
                  relations between perceptions of novelty and risk. We provide
                  an empirical test of this assumption in two studies in which
                  participants rate the novelty, usefulness, and riskiness of
                  ideas. Across both studies, we find consistent support for the
                  idea that usefulness, rather than novelty, has the strongest
                  relation with risk perceptions. We also find some evidence
                  that novelty and usefulness interact to predict perceptions of
                  risk. Additionally, in Study 2, we find that usefulness has
                  the strongest relation with willingness to invest and buy a
                  product. The findings of this study suggest that the bias
                  against creativity may be driven by the perceived usefulness
                  of an idea, rather than its novelty, such that ideas with
                  lower usefulness are perceived to be riskier.},

                  not necessarily overt and that is activated when people
                  experience a motivation to reduce uncertainty. In two

                  methods, including an uncertainty-reduction prime. The results

                  bias against creativity (relative to practicality) when
                  participants experienced uncertainty. Furthermore, this bias

                  orientation to the host culture, while orientation to culture

                  insight into the effects of music activities on acculturative

                  to Germany ( n = 80) was compared with migrants who had never

                  stress and a stronger orientation to mainstream culture

                  The association between music group membership and
                  acculturative stress was mediated by orientation to host
                  culture. Solo-musicians ( n = 38) did not differ from

                  the study groups. The findings suggest that (group) music

                  emotions changed in a social context. While some research has
                  used the term to refer to instances where others are used to
                  alter one’s own emotions (intrinsic), other research refers to
                  goal-directed actions aimed at modifying others’ emotional
                  responses (extrinsic). We argue that the self-other
                  distinction should be applied not only to the target (who has
                  their emotion regulated) but also to the means (whether the
                  agent uses themselves or others to achieve the regulation).
                  Based on this, we propose interpersonal emotion regulation can
                  take place when an agent changes a target’s emotions by
                  affecting a third party’s emotion who will shift the emotion
                  of the target in turn (direct other-based interpersonal ER) or
                  by impacting a third party’s emotion (indirect other-based
                  interpersonal ER). We discuss these processes and the

                  assessment to collect daily measurements of sleep, physical
                  activity and mood in a sample of N = 82 over multi-month data

                  cognition (g = 0.13 ± 0.04; BF = 3.67) and decrease reaction
                  time. A meta-analysis restricted to executive function tasks
                  revealed improvements in working memory and inhibition.
                  Meta-analytic estimates were consistent across multiple priors
                  and likelihood functions. Physical activities were categorized
                  based on exercise type (e.g., cycling) because many activities
                  have aerobic and anaerobic components, but this approach may
                  limit comparison to studies that categorize activities based
                  on metabolic demands. The current study provides an updated
                  synthesis of the existing literature and insights into the
                  robustness of acute exercise-induced effects on cognition.

                  interactional characteristics of virtual influencers. We
                  conduct an exploratory study of three parts. First, through an
                  indepth review of the existing literature, we delineate the
                  implications of unsettled taxonomies of virtual influencers by
                  function and form, and we outline a revised typology. Second,
                  our secondary review of virtual influencer literature, trade,
                  and industry sources conceptualizes divergent factors
                  influencing the persuasive capability of human and virtual

                  knowledge is limited by a focus on interoceptive accuracy and
                  laboratory-based interoception measures. This
                  experience-sampling study examines how state interoceptive
                  attention and state emotional experience are related in
                  everyday life, providing the first data to our knowledge
                  examining: (1) within-subject fluctuations in interoceptive
                  attention across domains, and (2) the relationship between
                  trait and state interoception. Compared with rates of
                  exteroceptive attention (auditory attention: engaged 83\% of
                  the time), interoceptive signals captured attention
                  approximately 20\% of the time, with substantial within- and
                  between-person variability across domains. There were
                  relationships between interoceptive attention and emotion in
                  daily life (greater attention being associated with more
                  negative valence and fatigue) that were specific to
                  interoceptive attention (different patterns were observed with
                  exteroceptive attention). State measures of interoceptive (but
                  not exteroceptive) attention were correlated with the trait
                  interoceptive attention, but not accuracy. Results underscore
                  the relationship between interoceptive attention and emotion,
                  providing new insights into interoceptive attention and the
                  structure of interoceptive ability. Future research should
                  examine the source(s) of within- and between-person
                  variability in interoceptive and exteroceptive attention and

                  Psychological adaptations for producing things that early
                  humans needed to survive and thrive, such as cognitive
                  mechanisms for obtaining and processing food, toolmaking, and
                  learning valuable working skills, evolved in the context of
                  small networks of hunter–gatherers. These adaptations are
                  central to understanding the significance of work in human
                  evolution. Evolutionary mismatches operate when novel
                  environments cue ancestral adaptations in ways that no longer
                  provide adaptive benefits. We argue that digital work,
                  although efficient and productive, is misaligned with some
                  fundamental human needs, preferences, and routines, thereby
                  illuminating a potential dark side. Yet digitalization also
                  offers opportunities for matching the modern work environment
                  to our evolved work psychology. We conclude with an agenda for
                  advancing research in industrial and organizational psychology

                  evidence for ethnic discrimination after resume screening, the
                  majority of those studies focused on outcomes of evaluating
                  job applications. Therefore, we know little about what happens
                  during resume screening. In the present study (N = 402), we
                  tested whether impressions of majority and minority applicants
                  are formed differently while processing separate snippets from
                  job applications. While majority impressions were
                  significantly more positive than minority impressions after
                  the third snippet was processed, impressions did not differ
                  anymore after four or more snippets. In specific, minority
                  impressions improved significantly more in response to the
                  fourth snippet, which provided information on a volunteering
                  role. Furthermore, we found that negative information
                  similarly harmed majority and minority impressions. Our
                  findings suggest that minority applicants might suffer from
                  prejudice if only little information from resumes is being
                  processed. Thus, organizations might be able to prevent
                  discriminatory outcomes by avoiding superficial resume

                  extreme in their characteristics than those of high
                  prevalence. We extended this idea to minorities, which by
                  definition have fewer members than majorities, and found
                  converging evidence for a minority extremity bias (MEB; N =
                  957). Participants associated the term ‘minority’ (rather than
                  ‘majority’) with higher extremity (Study 1). Minorities were
                  associated with higher extremity than majorities (Study 2). We
                  added a manipulation of the minority size (Study 3, Part 1).
                  Results indicated that the MEB is stronger for very small
                  minorities than for small minorities. Participants assigned
                  extreme behaviour more often to a minority than to a majority
                  (Study 3, Part 2). We extended the MEB to more extreme ratings
                  of minorities on evaluation scales (Study 4). Prevalence of
                  group members correlated negatively with the extremity of
                  group stereotyping (n = 118 groups; Study 5). Participants
                  rated minorities on induced stereotypes more extreme than
                  majorities (Study 6). We discuss the MEB in the context of
                  alternative explanations such as the outgroup extremity
                  effect. Taken together, this research demonstrates the MEB,
                  which is a novel exploration in the realm of group evaluation

                  during solitude was key to peaceful affect, whereas competence
                  satisfaction during solitude contributed to lower loneliness;
                  both psychological needs in solitude contributed to evaluating
                  the day as more satisfying. Relatedness‐deficiency in solitude
                  did not contribute to loneliness; instead, those who were
                  relatedness‐deficient in social interactions felt lonely.
                  Further, need satisfaction in solitude compensated for
                  deficient needs in social contexts, reducing loneliness

                  of market inefficiencies. In a meta‐analysis of 598
                  observations across 129 articles, the authors find that
                  non‐physical (vs. physical) goods have significantly larger
                  seller–buyer valuation disparities (i.e., larger endowment

                  valuations of non‐physical goods are asymmetrically influenced

                  prominent people’s degree of recognition by individuals and
                  society, and the formation of men’s and women’s self-concepts.
                  We found that power (status) ratings predicted greater

                  categories typically classify emotions in terms of a limited

                  because they arguably misrepresent the diversity of our

                  relationships, to personal possessions and the environment,
                  the things people value require regular care. When maintaining
                  a friendship, for instance, one may need to catch‐up
                  regularly, share life updates and offer support, and
                  occasionally make time to meet and spend time together.
                  Distinct from the more commonly studied approach and avoidance
                  goals, maintenance goals focus on sustaining current states
                  over time, a process that has recently begun to attract
                  increasing scholarly attention. This paper explores the
                  construct of maintenance goals; It provides a comprehensive
                  review of key findings and offers a novel perspective on the
                  potential role of maintenance in individual and collective

                  choice of real or imagined rewards. Across 10 experiments (and
                  an additional four in the Supplemental Material) and 3,412
                  participants (including the ones in the Supplemental
                  Material), we show that a short creative ideation (vs.
                  control) task led to more indulgent eating, drinking, and
                  exercise choices and behaviors. Participants who generated
                  creative ideas subsequently assembled burgers with higher
                  calorie content (Studies 1a, 3a, 3b, 4), proposed cocktails
                  with higher alcohol content (Study 1b), planned workouts that
                  burned fewer calories (Study 1c), chose candy more often
                  (Study 1d), and ate more candy (Study 2) than participants who
                  engaged in control tasks. In line with the perspective that
                  creativity involves disinhibition, these effects were mediated
                  by the behavioral activation system, which is thought to
                  underlie the uninhibited pursuit of desires and rewards
                  (Studies 2, 3a, 4). Furthermore, an experiment in which we
                  manipulated the behavioral activation system showed a causal
                  effect on indulgent eating choices (Study 5). We discuss the
                  implications for future research on the consequences of
                  creativity as well as the possibility that creative work might
                  lead to indulgent, potentially unhealthy choices and

                  narratives about the extent and nature of gender bias in
                  mediated campaigning environments diversify. Yet there is
                  still little understanding of how voters substantively think
                  about gender in their evaluations of women and men candidates
                  and how voters' thoughts are affected by different types of
                  media coverage. Drawing on literature on gender stereotyping
                  and rationalization, this paper distinguishes two roles in
                  which gender manifests in the candidate evaluation process—as
                  a heuristic and as a rationalization. We empirically
                  investigate these different ways in which gender affects
                  voters' thoughts following neutral and contextually rich
                  candidate stimuli by means of a mixed methods think aloud
                  study. The results show that voters think less—but more
                  positively—about substantive aspects of women's political
                  profiles. These favorable thoughts include heuristic
                  inferences of communal traits for women but not men
                  candidates. Moreover, we find that voter rationalizations
                  involve gender as ex post vote justifications and socially
                  desirable drivers of candidate evaluations. Together, the
                  findings not only showcase the complex roles of gender in
                  voters' candidate evaluations but also the importance of
                  considering the normative context in which vote decisions take

                  NBA are reference‐dependent and attempts to identify the
                  reference point. Using data from 10 NBA seasons (12,890
                  games), I find that teams are more likely to attempt a riskier
                  three‐point shot (vs. a less risky two‐point shot) when below
                  the reference point than above it, consistent with Prospect
                  Theory. The results further show that teams are not influenced
                  by a single fixed reference point, but instead, their choices
                  depend on the score difference, most recent score change, and
                  pregame expectations. Additionally, the weight given to the
                  reference point changes over the course of the game. Teams
                  show a breakeven effect, such that they are more likely to
                  attempt a three‐point shot when doing so can tie the game.
                  They also show behavior consistent with mental accounting, as
                  the reference point carries more weight at the end of a
                  quarter than at the beginning. These results provide further
                  real‐world evidence for reference‐dependent risk preferences
                  while highlighting the challenge of applying
                  reference‐dependent models to real‐world settings.},

                  PSMW as a distinctive, flexible way through which workers can
                  traverse complicated work and non-work borders and communicate
                  multiple (even conflicting) identities on social media. Third,

  abstract     = {In this essay, I begin with the premise that everyday
                  organizing is inextricably bound up with materiality and
                  contend that this relationship is inadequately reflected in
                  organizational studies that tend to ignore it, take it for
                  granted, or treat it as a special case. The result is an
                  understanding of organizing and its conditions and
                  consequences that is necessarily limited. I then argue for an
                  alternative approach, one that posits the constitutive
                  entanglement of the social and the material in everyday life.
                  I draw on some empirical examples to help ground and
                  illustrate this approach in practice and conclude by
                  suggesting that a reconfiguration of our conventional
                  assumptions and considerations of materiality will help us
                  more effectively recognize and understand the multiple,
                  emergent, and shifting sociomaterial assemblages entailed in
                  contemporary organizing.},

                  C. Lebiere, 1998) has evolved into a theory that consists of
                  multiple modules but also explains how these modules are
                  integrated to produce coherent cognition. The perceptual-motor
                  modules, the goal module, and the declarative memory module
                  are presented as examples of specialized systems in ACT-R.
                  These modules are associated with distinct cortical regions.
                  These modules place chunks in buffers where they can be
                  detected by a production system that responds to patterns of
                  information in the buffers. At any point in time, a single
                  production rule is selected to respond to the current pattern.
                  Subsymbolic processes serve to guide the selection of rules to
                  fire as well as the internal operations of some modules. Much
                  of learning involves tuning of these subsymbolic processes. A

                  identified as the key to unlocking the full potential of
                  generative AI technologies by optimizing human-AI
                  communication. Through a comprehensive analysis of the related
                  literature, this study illustrates how prompt engineering
                  transcends mere technical manipulation, requiring a blend of
                  creativity, strategic thinking, and a deep understanding of
                  generative AI capabilities. This paper provides various
                  strategies for crafting effective prompts, from simple to
                  sophisticated techniques, highlighting the importance of
                  ethical considerations and the potential risks associated with
                  prompt manipulation. By establishing a set of principles and
                  guidelines, this paper aims to advance prompt engineering as a
                  discipline essential for enhancing AI’s functionality and
                  reliability and, with this justification, introduces the
                  ‘Prompt Engineering for Gen[i]erative AI Framework’. After

  abstract     = {Despite increasing interest in warmth and competence as
                  fundamental dimensions in consumers’ evaluation of service
                  providers, prior research remains ambiguous about which
                  dimension is more important. The current study develops a
                  nomological framework that clarifies this ambiguity and
                  explains whether, when, and why warmth or competence takes
                  precedence for different outcomes in customer-service provider
                  relationships. Combined evidence from field and laboratory
                  studies support the notion of an asymmetric dominance, which
                  suggests that warmth is dominant in driving outcomes that
                  capture relational aspects (e.g., customer-company
                  identification), whereas competence is dominant in driving
                  outcomes that capture transactional aspects of the
                  customer-service provider relationship (e.g., share of
                  wallet). The findings provide first insights into the
                  underlying mechanisms that drive this asymmetric dominance by
                  demonstrating that relational and capability concerns mediate
                  this process. Moreover, the current investigation identifies
                  novel moderators that offer managers help in identifying
                  service contexts (people vs. object care) and customer
                  segments (differing in process and outcome service goals) for
                  which investing in warmth or competence is more promising.
                  Overall, displaying competence is particular effective in
                  driving customer attraction and current operating performance,
                  whereas displaying warmth is better suited to establish strong
                  emotional bonds and drive customer retention.},

                  marketing insight. But while work has shed light on what firms
                  should say to customers, when to say those things (e.g.,
                  within an advertisement or sales interaction) is less clear.
                  Service employees, for example, could adopt a certain speaking
                  style at a conversation's start, end, or throughout. When
                  might specific language features be beneficial? This article
                  introduces a novel approach to address this question. To
                  demonstrate its potential, we apply it to warm and competent
                  language. Prior research suggests that an affective (i.e.,
                  warm) speaking approach leads customers to think employees are
                  less competent, so a cognitive (competent) style should be
                  prioritized. In contrast, our theorizing, analysis of hundreds
                  of real service conversations from two firms across thousands
                  of conversational moments (N = 23,958), and four experiments
                  (total N = 1,589) offer a more nuanced perspective. Customers
                  are more satisfied when employees use both cognitive and
                  affective language but at separate, specific times. Ancillary
                  analyses show how this method can be applied to other language
                  features. Taken together, this work offers a method to explore
                  when language matters, sheds new light on the
                  warmth/competence trade-off, and highlights ways to improve
                  the customer experience.},

                  patience, and these preferences are heavily influenced by
                  others. Previous research suggests that susceptibility to
                  social influence may vary with age, but the mechanisms and
                  whether people are more influenced by patience or impulsivity
                  remain unknown. Here, using a delegated inter-temporal choice
                  task and Bayesian computational models, we tested
                  susceptibility to social influence in young (aged 18–36, N =
                  76) and older (aged 60–80, N = 78) adults. Participants
                  completed a temporal discounting task and then learnt the
                  preferences of two other people (one more impulsive and one
                  more patient) before making their choices again. We used the
                  signed Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantify the magnitude
                  and direction of social influence. We found that, compared to
                  young adults, older adults were relatively more susceptible to
                  impulsive social influence. Factor analyses showed that older
                  adults with higher self-reported levels of affective empathy
                  and emotional motivation were particularly susceptible to
                  impulsive influence. Importantly, older and young adults
                  showed similar learning accuracy about others’ preferences,
                  and their baseline impulsivity did not differ. Together, these
                  findings suggest highly affectively empathetic and emotionally
                  motivated older adults may be at higher risk for impulsive
                  decisions, due to their susceptibility to social influence.},

                  present a conceptual framework that distinguishes three
                  mechanisms of organism-environment interaction. We call these
                  NC3 mechanisms: niche construction, in which individuals make
                  changes to the environment; niche choice, in which individuals
                  select an environment; and niche conformance, in which
                  individuals adjust their phenotypes in response to the
                  environment. Each of these individual-level mechanisms affects
                  an individual's phenotype-environment match, its fitness, and
                  its individualized niche, defined in terms of the
                  environmental conditions under which the individual can
                  survive and reproduce. Our framework identifies how
                  individuals alter the selective regimes that they and other
                  organisms experience. It also places clear emphasis on
                  individual differences and construes niche construction and
                  other processes as evolved mechanisms. The NC3 mechanism

                  participation and subjective well-being and the role gender in
                  this issue among elderly Chinese in Shanghai, China. METHODS:
                  Principal components analysis and logistic regressions are
                  used to analyze the cross-sectional data of the 2013 Shanghai
                  Elderly Life and Opinion Survey that contains 2884 respondents
                  (60+ with a mean age of 72.6) recruited from a multistage
                  cluster sampling design. Subjective well-being is measured by
                  happiness and life satisfaction, and leisure participation is
                  examined by the type and diversity of leisure activities.
                  RESULTS: Principal components analysis identifies four major
                  types of leisure activity that elderly Chinese are actively
                  engaged in-detachment-recovery, aesthetic, social, and
                  performing-arts activities. Among them, social activities and
                  performing-arts activities have the most relevance to
                  subjective well-being. Females are more likely to engage in
                  social and performing-arts activities whereas males are more
                  likely to engage in detachment-recovery and aesthetic
                  activities. Performing-arts activities promote subjective
                  well-being only for females. Social activities are beneficial
                  for both gender groups, but more so for males than for
                  females. While increased levels of leisure diversity are
                  linearly related to increased odds of subjective well-being
                  for females, moderate level of leisure diversity is found to
                  be the most important for males. CONCLUSIONS: Leisure
                  participation is positively related to subjective well-being
                  among elderly Chinese, and thus could play a critical role in
                  promoting healthy aging. The major gender differences as
                  observed suggest the need to further explore gender-specific
                  barriers in leisure participation.},

                  causes of variety-seeking explore the influence of consumers'
                  internal psychological characteristics on behavioral
                  decisions, few studies have been conducted on external
                  factors. With the fast pace of modern life and the increasing
                  trend of online shopping, consumers often face time
                  constraints when making purchasing decisions. This study
                  examines the impact of time pressure as a significant external
                  environmental factor on consumers' variety-seeking behavior. A
                  conceptual framework is developed based on construal level
                  theory to uncover the influencing mechanism of time pressure
                  on variety-seeking behavior while also considering the effects
                  of the consumer's personality and emotional state. We
                  conducted two experiments to investigate the moderating effect
                  of regulatory focus from the personality perspective and
                  excitement level from the emotional state perspective. Study 1
                  found that time pressure significantly affects variety-seeking
                  behavior. Additionally, consumers with prevention regulatory
                  focus tend to exhibit more variety-seeking behavior when not
                  under time pressure. Study 2 supports the main effect and
                  shows that the level of excitement affects the impact of time
                  pressure on variety-seeking behavior. Therefore, this study
                  contributes to the literature on consumer behavior and
                  purchasing decisions by presenting a robust theoretical
                  framework that provides practical insights and implications

                  on three popular online academic databases to understand how

                  61 articles on variety-seeking behaviors in consumer research,
                  including empirical studies spanning from 2000 to 2021. This
                  paper primarily focused on articles published at top tiers in
                  the marketing literature. From these articles, a collection of
                  internal and external factors, theoretical perspectives,
                  underlying mechanisms, and measure methods adopted was
                  summarized and tabulated for easy reference and comprehension.

                  result from deficits in humans (ingroup-favoring motives,
                  cognitive biases) or their environments (majority advantages,
                  real group differences). An alternative explanation recently
                  proposed that stereotypes can emerge when exploration is
                  costly. Even optimal decision makers in an ideal environment
                  can inadvertently form incorrect impressions from arbitrary
                  encounters. However, all these existing theories essentially
                  describe shortcuts that fail to explain the
                  multidimensionality of stereotypes. Stereotypes of social
                  groups have a canonical multidimensional structure, organized
                  along dimensions of warmth and competence. We show that these
                  dimensions and the associated stereotypes can result from
                  feature-based exploration: When individuals make
                  self-interested decisions based on past experiences in an
                  environment where exploring new options carries an implicit
                  cost and when these options share similar attributes, they are
                  more likely to separate groups along multiple dimensions. We
                  formalize this theory via the contextual multiarmed bandit
                  problem, use the resulting model to generate testable
                  predictions, and evaluate those predictions against human
                  behavior. We evaluate this process in incentivized decisions
                  involving as many as 20 real jobs and successfully recover the
                  classic dimensions of warmth and competence. Further
                  experiments show that intervening on the cost of exploration
                  effectively mitigates bias, further demonstrating that
                  exploration cost per se is the operating variable. Future
                  diversity interventions may consider how to reduce exploration
                  cost, in ways that parallel our manipulations. (PsycInfo

                  dimensions of warmth and

                  survey to collect professionals´ (mostly recruiters´) ratings
                  of preselected occupations. Participants were asked to rate
                  warmth and competence attributes. Factor and cluster analysis
                  were employed to investigate the two-dimensional structure of
                  the warmth/competence space and how and whether occupations
                  cluster as predicted by the stereotype content model
                  (SCM).FindingsAlmost all occupations showed a clear
                  two-factorial structure, corresponding to the
                  warmth/competence dimensions. A five-cluster solution was
                  deemed appropriate as depicting how occupations disperse on
                  these dimensions. Implications for stereotyping research, the
                  design of hiring discrimination experiments, and HRM are

                  research, in which participants select the included
                  occupations themselves, the authors included prespecified
                  common occupations, which should be important for
                  representativeness. In addition, previous research has been
                  conducted in the United States, while the authors conduct this
                  study in a European context (Sweden). Finally, instead of
                  studying students or participants with unspecified work
                  experience, the authors focus on professionals (mostly
                  recruiters).},

                  stereotypes can be activated by presenting either
                  characteristic traits of group members, or labels associated
                  to these groups. However, it is not clear whether these pieces
                  of semantic information activate negative and positive
                  stereotypes directly, or via an indirect cognitive pathway
                  leading through brain regions responsible for affective
                  responses. Our main objective with this study was to
                  disentangle the effects of semantic and affective contents. To
                  this end, we intended to scrutinize whether the representation
                  of occupational labels is independent of the emotions they
                  evoke. METHODS: Participants (N = 73, M = 27.0, SD = 9.1, 31
                  men 42 women,) were asked to complete two tasks presented
                  online. In the first task they had to arrange 20 occupational
                  labels-randomly chosen from a pool of 60 items-in a
                  two-dimensional space, moving the mouse pointer along two
                  undefined axes. In a second task the axes' names were defined
                  a priori. Subjects were asked to arrange the labels according
                  to valence, the extent to which the word evoked pleasant or
                  unpleasant feelings, and arousal, the extent to which the word
                  evoked excitement or calmness. RESULTS: Based on the final
                  coordinates of the labels, two cluster analyses were carried
                  out separately in the two tasks. The two clusters were
                  compared with Fisher's exact test, which revealed that the
                  cluster structures overlap significantly. CONCLUSIONS: The
                  results suggest that the spontaneous categorization and the
                  semantic representation of occupations rely largely on the
                  affective state they evoke. We propose that affective content
                  might have a primacy over detailed semantic information in
                  many aspects of person perception, including social
                  categorization.},

                  definition of the concept of personal branding processes and
                  the resulting human brands. A multi-step analysis of the
                  growing body of literature on personal branding is employed,
                  integrating a framework that covers six key research streams
                  of personal branding, (1) terminology and definition, (2)
                  underlying theories, (3) classes and categories, (4) benefits,
                  (5) antecedents, and (6) key ingredients and applications,
                  complemented by challenges the domain of personal branding has
                  to cope with. The analysis shows that personal branding is an
                  interdisciplinary concern, which is still in its infancy and
                  in which universally valid personal branding frameworks or

                  But given circadian rhythms in chronobiology, might
                  variety-seeking vary by time of day? Four studies, including
                  an empirical analysis of millions of purchases, demonstrate
                  diurnal variation in variety-seeking. Variety-seeking is lower
                  in the morning than other times of day. People pick less
                  varied flavors of yogurt, for example, when choosing in the
                  morning. Further, the results demonstrate the underlying role
                  of circadian changes in physiological stimulation and arousal.
                  The effect is mediated by a physiological measure of arousal
                  (i.e., body temperature) and moderated by factors that shape
                  physiological arousal (i.e., sunlight and individual
                  differences in circadian preferences). These findings shed

                  consideration for the causal inference frameworks used
                  elsewhere. This leaves researchers ill‐equipped to solve
                  inferential problems that they encounter in their work,
                  leading to mistaken conclusions and incoherent statistical
                  analyses. For a more systematic approach to causal inference,
                  this article provides brief introductions to the potential
                  outcomes framework—the “lingua franca” of causal inference—and
                  to directed acyclic graphs, a graphical notation that makes it
                  easier to systematically reason about complex causal
                  situations. I then discuss two issues that may be of interest
                  to researchers in social and personality psychology who think
                  that formalized causal inference is of little relevance to
                  their work. First, posttreatment bias: In various common
                  scenarios (noncompliance, mediation analysis, missing data),
                  researchers may analyze data from experimental studies in a
                  manner that results in internally invalid conclusions, despite
                  randomization. Second, tests of incremental validity: Routine
                  practices in personality psychology suggest that they may be
                  conducted for at least two different reasons (to demonstrate
                  the non‐redundancy of new scales, to support causal
                  conclusions) without being particularly suited for either
                  purpose. Taking causal inference seriously is challenging; it
                  reveals assumptions that may make many uncomfortable. However,
                  ultimately it is a necessary step to ensure the validity of
                  psychological research.},

                  First, we examine the extent to which sport gives social

                  compared to other status markers and how sport and other
                  various status markers vary by age, gender and cultural class.
                  Second, we study how sport performances influence social
                  status (popularity and likeability) among athletes. We
                  hypothesise that (i) sport has a high status in general and
                  especially among sport participants, (ii) sport loses
                  attraction by age, but less so among sport participants than
                  the general youth population, (iii) sport gives more status to
                  boys than girls and (iv) sport performances influence
                  athletes’ popularity and likability. We use data from the

                  high status, especially among young sporting males. Cultural
                  class seems less important for sport status. For status within

                  habitual—that is, ensuring a behaviour is prompted
                  automatically on exposure to situational cues, based on
                  cue‐response associations learnt through context‐consistent
                  repetition—is portrayed as a mechanism for sustaining such
                  behaviours over time. Conversely, disrupting ‘bad’ habits is
                  expected to terminate longstanding unwanted actions. Yet, some
                  commentators have suggested that the role of habit in
                  real‐world behaviour and behaviour change has been overstated.
                  Such critiques highlight a gap between habit theory and the
                  reality of human behaviour ‘in the wild’. This
                  state‐of‐the‐field review aims to narrow this gap. Building on
                  a core distinction between habit and habitual behaviour, our
                  review seeks to offer interpretations of habit theory and
                  evidence that will better manage intervention designers'
                  expectations regarding how modifying habit can realistically
                  be expected to promote behaviour change. We emphasise that
                  habit is just one potential influence on behaviour at any
                  given moment, and highlight instances in which habit may
                  dominate over intention, and in which intention may dominate
                  over habit, in determining behaviour frequency. We suggest
                  that, while it may assist behaviour maintenance, habit
                  formation may be neither necessary nor sufficient to sustain
                  real‐world behaviour change. We draw attention to the various
                  ways in which habit may be ‘broken’ (i.e., disrupted), and
                  discern the implications of each habit disruption mechanism
                  for long‐term cessation of unwanted behaviours.},

  abstract     = {Throughout history, art creation has been regarded as a
                  uniquely human means to express original ideas, emotions, and
                  experiences. However, as Generative Artificial Intelligence
                  reshapes visual, aesthetic, legal, and economic culture,
                  critical questions arise about the moral and aesthetic
                  implications of AI-generated art. Despite the growing use of
                  AI tools in art, the moral impact of AI involvement in the art
                  creation process remains underexplored. Understanding moral
                  judgments of AI-generated art is essential for assessing AI's
                  impact on art and its alignment with ethical norms. Across
                  three pre-registered experiments combining explicit and
                  implicit paradigms with Bayesian modelling, we examined how
                  information about AI systems influences moral and aesthetic
                  judgments and whether human art is implicitly associated with
                  positive attributes compared to AI-generated art. Experiment 1
                  revealed that factual information about AI backend processes
                  reduced moral acceptability and aesthetic appeal in certain
                  contexts, such as gaining financial incentives and art status.
                  Experiment 2 showed that additional information about AI art's
                  success had no clear impact on moral judgments. Experiment 3
                  demonstrated that an implicit association task did not
                  reliably link human art with positive attributes and AI art
                  with negative ones. These findings show that factual
                  information about AI systems shapes judgments, while different
                  information doses about AI art's success have limited moral
                  impact. Additionally, implicit associations between human-made
                  and AI-generated art are similar. This work enhances
                  understanding of moral and aesthetic perceptions of
                  AI-generated art, emphasizing the importance of examining
                  human-AI interactions in an arts context, and their current
                  and evolving societal implications.},

                  Extending prior work that has identified individual and
                  situational antecedents of risk taking, we explore a
                  significant relational antecedent: rivalry. In both a field
                  setting and a laboratory experiment, we explore how a
                  competitor’s identity and relationship with the decision maker
                  influences risk taking. We analyze play-by-play archival data
                  from the National Football League and find that interactions
                  with rival (versus nonrival) partners increases risky
                  behavior. In a laboratory experiment involving face-to-face
                  competition, we demonstrate that rivalry increases risk taking
                  via two pathways: increased promotion focus and physiological
                  arousal. These findings highlight the importance of
                  incorporating relational characteristics to understand risk
                  taking. Our findings also advance our understanding of when
                  and why competition promotes risk taking, and underscore the
                  importance of identity and relationships in the psychology and
                  physiology of competitive decision making in organizations.

                  series of advantages that sports data offers to management

                  avoid the drawbacks of leveraging sports contexts. To do so,
                  we identify and review 249 papers published over the last 50
                  years that used sports data to advance management theories and
                  shed light on managerial phenomena. After outlining how these

                  in management research, we discuss the advantages of using
                  sports data by outlining how they can advance management

                  them. We close by outlining several new directions in which

                  such challenges requires more explorations into the impact of
                  personal factors on income generation. Accordingly, we
                  investigated the significance of 400 creative professionals'
                  entrepreneurial or artistic identities and business skills in
                  their income adequacy on the basis of role identity theory.
                  Our findings show that business skills support the likelihood
                  of income adequacy but that artistic identity reduces it. The
                  combination of entrepreneurial identity with business skills
                  increases income adequacy, whereas entrepreneurial identity
                  alone has no influence. These results point to the complexity
                  of individuals' income formation and the need to study the

                  of the mechanisms underlying social influence by applying a
                  diffusion model analysis. Here, we combined the social
                  identity approach to social influence with a diffusion model
                  analysis to unravel the mechanisms underlying social
                  influence. In particular, we aimed to disentangle whether the
                  difference between in‐group and out‐group influence on
                  perceptual decision‐making is driven by a judgmental bias
                  (i.e., changes in decision criteria) or a perceptual bias
                  (i.e., changes in the uptake of sensory information).
                  Preregistered analyses indicated that in‐groups exerted
                  stronger social influence than out‐groups because in‐groups
                  induced a stronger perceptual bias than out‐groups. This
                  finding is in line with the single process assumption of the
                  social identity approach because it implicates that the single
                  process driving social influence (i.e., self‐categorisation)
                  translates into a change in a single subprocess of
                  decision‐making (i.e., biased information uptake). In
                  conclusion, our results highlight that our theoretical
                  understanding of social influence can be expanded by
                  integrating the social identity approach with a diffusion

                  popularity of Chapman’s book The 5 Love Languages, there is a
                  paucity of empirical work on love languages, and collectively,
                  it does not provide strong empirical support for the book’s
                  three central assumptions that (a) each person has a preferred
                  love language, (b) there are five love languages, and (c)

                  has revealed the profound influence of culture on cognitive,
                  emotional, and motivational processes shaping individuals into
                  active agents. This article aims to show cultural psychology's
                  promise in three key steps. First, we review four notable
                  cultural dimensions believed to underlie cultural variations:
                  independent versus interdependent self, individualism versus
                  collectivism, tightness versus looseness of social norms, and
                  relational mobility. Second, we examine how ecology and
                  geography shape human activities and give rise to organized
                  systems of cultural practices and meanings, called
                  eco-cultural complexes. In turn, the eco-cultural complex of
                  each zone is instrumental in shaping a wide range of
                  psychological processes, revealing a psychological diversity
                  that extends beyond the scope of the current East–West
                  literature. Finally, we examine some of the non-Western
                  cultural zones present today, including Arab, East Asian,
                  Latin American, and South Asian zones, and discuss how they
                  may have contributed, to varying degrees, to the formation of
                  the contemporary Western cultural zone.},

                  discussion of important EP principles including the
                  domain‐specificity of the human mind, and the difference
                  between ultimate and proximate scientific explanations. The
                  evolutionary bases of memory, attitude formation/change,
                  emotions, perception (our five senses), personality, and
                  decision making are addressed next, along with specific links
                  to consumer research. Next, I demonstrate how numerous
                  consumer acts could be classified into one of four basal
                  Darwinian modules: survival, reproduction (mating), kin
                  selection, and reciprocal altruism. The paper continues with
                  an exploration of the evolutionary roots of cultural products
                  (e.g., song lyrics) and Darwinian happiness (along with the
                  evolutionary etiology of maladaptive phenomena such as
                  pathological gambling and compulsive buying). I conclude with
                  a discussion of key epistemological benefits of Darwinizing
                  consumer research including greater consilience, increased
                  interdisciplinarity, and an ethos of methodological pluralism.},

                  benefits of self‐control in professional contexts: People
                  prefer high self‐control individuals as work or study partners
                  and expect them to perform better than low self‐control
                  individuals. We show that these benefits of self‐control
                  reverse in the artistic domain. Results of one pilot study and
                  five preregistered online experiments (N = 1644) reveal that
                  artists with high (vs. low) self‐control are perceived as less
                  creative. This effect replicates across various artistic
                  domains (visual art, music, poetry, screenwriting), holds for
                  both male and female artists and can be explained by
                  perceptions of lower experiential processing, which is
                  considered indispensable for creativity. However, art created
                  by high (vs. low) self‐control artists is ascribed higher
                  market value due to stronger attributions of productivity.
                  These findings provide novel insights into the social
                  perception of self‐control and contribute to the understudied
                  topic of the downsides of self‐control as well as to the

                  findings by documenting a familiar occasion in which those who
                  are objectively better off nonetheless feel worse. In
                  particular, an analysis of the emotional reactions of bronze
                  and silver medalists at the 1992 Summer Olympics—both at the
                  conclusion of their events and on the medal stand—indicates
                  that bronze medalists tend to be happier than silver
                  medalists. The authors attribute these results to the fact
                  that the most compelling counterfactual alternative for the
                  silver medalist is winning the gold, whereas for the bronze
                  medalist it is finishing without a medal. Support for this
                  interpretation was obtained from the 1992 Olympics and the

               consumers do the things they do. We review prior research on
               consumer motivation, focusing on the central role played by goals
               in consumer behavior. We first discuss structural aspects of
               goals, including need hierarchies and typologies of values,
               hierarchical means‐end conceptualizations of product‐self
               relationships and goals, and a classification of purchase
               motives. We then describe the dynamics of goal pursuit,
               considering both goal setting and goal striving. Traditionally,
               these two processes have been viewed as conscious processes in
               which people deliberately select a goal and then strive to attain
               it. More recently, research has shown that goal pursuit can also

  abstract     = {AbstractLow levels of social interaction across class lines
                  have generated widespread concern1–4 and are associated with
                  worse outcomes, such as lower rates of upward income
                  mobility4–7. Here we analyse the determinants of cross-class
                  interaction using data from Facebook, building on the analysis
                  in our companion paper7. We show that about half of the social
                  disconnection across socioeconomic lines—measured as the
                  difference in the share of high-socioeconomic status (SES)
                  friends between people with low and high SES—is explained by
                  differences in exposure to people with high SES in groups such
                  as schools and religious organizations. The other half is
                  explained by friending bias—the tendency for people with low
                  SES to befriend people with high SES at lower rates even
                  conditional on exposure. Friending bias is shaped by the
                  structure of the groups in which people interact. For example,
                  friending bias is higher in larger and more diverse groups and
                  lower in religious organizations than in schools and
                  workplaces. Distinguishing exposure from friending bias is
                  helpful for identifying interventions to increase cross-SES
                  friendships (economic connectedness). Using fluctuations in
                  the share of students with high SES across high school
                  cohorts, we show that increases in high-SES exposure lead
                  low-SES people to form more friendships with high-SES people
                  in schools that exhibit low levels of friending bias. Thus,
                  socioeconomic integration can increase economic connectedness
                  in communities in which friending bias is low. By contrast,
                  when friending bias is high, increasing cross-SES interactions
                  among existing members may be necessary to increase economic
                  connectedness. To support such efforts, we release
                  privacy-protected statistics on economic connectedness,
                  exposure and friending bias for each ZIP (postal) code, high

                  positive and negative subscales. Both subscales captured
                  emotions in line with their valence. In addition, the positive
                  subscale reflected societal and personal utility, whereas the
                  negative subscale reflected concerns. The scale showed good
                  psychometric indices and convergent and discriminant validity
                  against existing measures. To cross-validate general attitudes
                  with attitudes towards specific instances of AI applications,
                  summaries of tasks accomplished by specific applications of
                  Artificial Intelligence were sourced from newspaper articles.
                  These were rated for comfortableness and perceived capability.
                  Comfortableness with specific applications was a strong
                  predictor of general attitudes as measured by the GAAIS, but
                  perceived capability was a weaker predictor. Participants
                  viewed AI applications involving big data (e.g. astronomy,
                  law, pharmacology) positively, but viewed applications for
                  tasks involving human judgement, (e.g. medical treatment,
                  psychological counselling) negatively. Applications with a
                  strong ethical dimension led to stronger discomfort than their
                  rated capabilities would predict. The survey data suggested
                  that people held mixed views of AI. The initially validated

                  to help you feel better? Maybe they could verbally comfort you
                  or maybe they could give you a small gift. In seven studies,
                  including an in‐person real gifting study, we find that
                  receiving a small material gift, such as a candy bar or
                  flowers, improves receivers' affect more than a supportive
                  conversation with a close other does. We investigate the
                  mechanism for this effect and find that support receivers
                  perceive a gift to be a larger sacrifice than a conversation.
                  This occurs because gifts seem more receiver‐focused (i.e.,
                  actions done solely to benefit the receiver) than do
                  conversations. This difference in perceived sacrifice makes
                  gifts (vs. conversations) more effective at promoting

                  utilitarian nature of products by employing a between-subjects

                  demonstrate that higher perceived warmth results in greater
                  expectations of hedonic product properties, and that higher
                  competence perceptions result in greater expectations of

                  experience, the musical features of songs could also
                  contribute to their subjective autobiographical saliency.
                  Songs which have been popular during adolescence or young
                  adulthood (ages 10–30) are more likely to evoke stronger
                  memories, a phenomenon known as a reminiscence bump. In the
                  present study, we sought to determine how song-specific age,
                  emotional responsiveness to music, musical features, and
                  subjective memory functioning contribute to the subjective
                  autobiographical saliency of music in older adults. In a music
                  listening study, 112 participants rated excerpts of popular
                  songs from the 1950s to the 1980s for autobiographical
                  saliency. Additionally, they filled out questionnaires about
                  emotional responsiveness to music and subjective memory
                  functioning. The song excerpts’ musical features were

                  that autobiographical saliency was best predicted by
                  song-specific age and emotional responsiveness to music and
                  musical features. Newer songs that were more similar in rhythm
                  to older songs were also rated higher in autobiographical
                  saliency. Overall, this study contributes to autobiographical

                  plays a role in perceiving brands' morality, personality, and

                  introduces and tests the Brands as Intentional Agents
                  Framework. A growing body of research suggests that consumers
                  have relationships with brands that resemble relations between
                  people. We propose that consumers perceive brands in the same
                  way they perceive people. This approach allows us to explore
                  how social perception theories and processes can predict brand
                  purchase interest and loyalty. Brands as Intentional Agents
                  Framework is based on a well-established social perception
                  approach: the Stereotype Content Model. Two studies support
                  the Brands as Intentional Agents Framework prediction that
                  consumers assess a brand's perceived intentions and ability
                  and that these perceptions elicit distinct emotions and drive
                  differential brand behaviors. The research shows that human
                  social interaction relationships translate to consumer-brand
                  interactions in ways that are useful to inform brand
                  positioning and brand communications.},

                  branding literature by examining the critical role of brand
                  stereotypes in shaping consumers’ brand‐related responses.
                  Drawing on the Stereotype Content Model, this article examines
                  how warmth and competence stereotypes impact consumers’
                  emotional reaction toward brands and in turn consumers’ brand
                  attitudes and behavioral intention. In addition, this article
                  examines how brand stereotypes mediate the relationships
                  between brand personality and consumers’ brand emotions. The
                  results from this study support the dual role of brand
                  stereotypes as relevant predictors of brand emotions, and
                  intervening variables mediating the effects from brand
                  personality perceptions on brand emotions. The findings
                  support the view that mechanisms of social perception apply to
                  brand perception and provide new insights about the
                  relationship between consumers’ brand perceptions and their

                  the adult life span and what factors influence these changes.
                  To address this, we conducted a coordinated data analysis of
                  nine longitudinal studies encompassing 128,118 participants
                  ages 13 to 103 from over 20 countries. Using harmonized
                  variables and models, we examined loneliness trajectories and
                  predictors. Analyses revealed that loneliness follows a
                  U-shaped curve, decreasing from young adulthood to midlife and
                  increasing in older adulthood. These patterns were consistent
                  across studies. Several baseline factors (i.e., sex, marital
                  status, physical function, education) were linked to
                  loneliness levels, but few moderated the loneliness
                  trajectories. These findings highlight the dynamic nature of
                  loneliness and underscore the need for targeted interventions

                  prefer promoted hedonic products when a company selects which
                  products to promote using chance rather than more traditional
                  intentional methods. This preference arises because consumers
                  can perceive chance selection as fun and consequently view a
                  company engaging in such chance selection as more fun. We find
                  converging evidence for this preference, demonstrating the
                  effect on consumer intentions, click‐through rates, and real
                  consumption decisions, while ruling out a variety of

                  preference is driven by heightened hedonic perceptions, we
                  find that this preference emerges for hedonic products but not
                  for utilitarian products, for which more traditional selection
                  methods are preferred.},

                  choose a product or service when the seller signals that they

                  lower prices, and actually charge less, for products and

                  the inference that production enjoyment leads to higher

  abstract     = {Abstract Across 10 experimental studies, this research
                  identifies and provides evidence of a disability preference
                  stereotype whereby observers infer that disabled consumers
                  prefer utilitarian products more than nondisabled consumers
                  and prefer hedonic products less than nondisabled consumers.
                  We show that this stereotype occurs because of societal
                  associations between physical disability and pity. Pity
                  elicits a multidimensional response such that considering the
                  interests of a disabled person increases feelings of personal
                  discomfort, driving both an inclination to help (help-giving
                  orientation) and a tendency to assess the perceived misfortune
                  (misfortune appraisal) in parallel. Thus, when considering the
                  preferences of disabled individuals, the help-giving
                  orientation increases focus on functional (utilitarian) goods,
                  while the misfortune appraisal decreases focus on pleasurable
                  (hedonic) goods. Importantly, this stereotype can be mitigated
                  through increased disability representation. Representation of
                  empowered disabled individuals in media can dampen the
                  help-giving orientation, reducing inferred utilitarian
                  preferences, while representation of disabled people partaking
                  in daily pleasures through increased accessibility can reduce
                  misfortune perceptions, increasing inferred hedonic
                  preferences. This work addresses the paucity of
                  disability-related consumer research, identifies how aspects
                  unique to consumption can limit consumers with disabilities,
                  and highlights opportunities to minimize ableist stereotypes
                  by expanding representation and increasing marketplace
                  inclusion.},

  abstract     = {SummaryThe consensus of the literature has suggested that
                  competition prompts individuals to act unethically. However,
                  prior research that explored the ethical implication of
                  competition has largely ignored the role of contexts within
                  its examination—studying competition generally independent of
                  other social relationships/actors. Drawing on the relational
                  perspective of competition (i.e., rivalry), we propose that
                  broader social relationships in which rivalry relationships
                  are embedded will give rise to alternative psychological
                  processes that can account for a curbing effect of rivalry on
                  workplace cheating behavior. Results from one pre‐registered
                  experiment and three surveys on working professionals suggest
                  that exposure to rivalry leads to a heightened perception of
                  peer monitoring, which in turn is associated with lower
                  cheating behavior at work. We further find that the effect of
                  rivalry on the perception of peer monitoring is stronger
                  (weaker) when employees' leader–member exchange (LMX)
                  relationship with their supervisor is lower (higher),
                  highlighting the significance of other social actors in the
                  rivalry process. This research complements the literature with
                  a balanced perspective regarding the ethical implication of
                  competition and contributes to the theory building of rivalry
                  by providing an interpersonal lens to the psychology of

                  positive attribute in food choices, as it positively impacts
                  consumers’ preferences. The current research demonstrates that
                  in contexts where there is a time delay between a food's
                  production and its consumption (referred to as
                  “about-to-expire” food), strong perceptions of a food's
                  healthiness can be detrimental. This is because consumers hold
                  a lay theory that healthy food expires more quickly. In eight
                  studies (N = 3,552), the authors find that merely portraying
                  food as healthy increases the perception that it expires
                  quickly and that this effect attenuates when consumers hold
                  the lay theory weakly or have a high level of knowledge about
                  food expiration. Importantly, this lay theory leads consumers
                  to avoid consuming healthy (vs. nonhealthy) about-to-expire
                  food, resulting in increased disposal intentions and decreased
                  preferences. In designing sales promotions for about-to-expire
                  food, managers should consider the healthiness of food
                  products, as consumers prefer different types of sales
                  promotions and require different magnitudes of price discounts
                  for healthy (vs. nonhealthy) about-to-expire food. Finally,
                  adding an expiration date label that provides unambiguous
                  guidance (i.e., “consume by”) can effectively mitigate the
                  detrimental effect of perceived healthiness on the consumption
                  for about-to-expire food.},

                  practice: Asians are commonly categorized as a monolithic
                  group in the United States. Regarding research, my 24-year
                  archival analysis of Psychological Science shows that most
                  U.S. studies did not specify which Asian subgroup(s) were
                  examined. Regarding practice, my analysis of the diversity,
                  equity, and inclusion (DEI) webpages and latest diversity
                  reports of S\&P 100 companies finds that none of them
                  differentiated between Asian subgroups. Such use of the
                  generic category “Asian” is problematic because it masks
                  important differences among Asian subgroups: (a) Of all ethnic
                  groups in the United States, socioeconomic inequality among
                  Asian subgroups is the highest and fastest growing; (b) U.S.
                  studies show that East Asians (e.g., ethnic Chinese)—but not
                  South Asians (e.g., ethnic Indians)—experience a “bamboo
                  ceiling” in consequential contexts, including leadership
                  attainment, academic performance in law and business schools,
                  and starting salaries. Thus, lumping Asians together can
                  obscure the challenges faced by certain Asian subgroups and
                  jeopardize the attention and resources they need. More

                  theorization, surveys, and data analysis) and practice (e.g.,
                  diversity reports) to foster DEI.},

                  attentional disengagement, in the context of a cognitive task,
                  can substantially differ between samples from commonly used
                  online participant recruitment platforms, Prolific and
                  Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Initially, eighty participants were
                  recruited through Prolific to perform an attention task in
                  which the risk of losing points for errors was varied (high
                  risk = 80\% chance of loss, low risk = 20\% chance of loss).
                  Attentional disengagement was measured via task performance
                  along with self-reported mind wandering and multitasking. On
                  Prolific, we observed surprisingly low levels of
                  disengagement. We then conducted the same experiment on MTurk.
                  Strikingly, MTurk participants exhibited more disengagement
                  than Prolific participants. There was also an interaction
                  between risk and platform, with the high-risk group exhibiting
                  less disengagement, in terms of better task performance, than
                  the low-risk group, but only on MTurk. Platform differences in
                  individual traits related to disengagement and relations among
                  study variables were also observed. Platform differences
                  persisted, but were smaller, after increasing MTurk reputation
                  criteria and remuneration in a second experiment. Therefore,
                  recruitment platform and recruitment criteria could impact
                  results related to attentional disengagement.},

                  the association of relationship quality dimensions with
                  loyalty was examined in a European high uncertainty avoidance
                  culture (Turkey) and an Asian low uncertainty avoidance
                  culture (Malaysia). Data were collected through a field survey
                  of randomly selected bank customers in Ankara and Kuala
                  Lumpur. Factor and Hierarchical Multiple Regression Analyses
                  (HMRA) were employed for data analysis. The results show that
                  relationship quality dimensions explain a significant amount
                  of variance in customer loyalty. Trust and satisfaction are
                  significantly associated with customer loyalty. Uncertainty
                  avoidance is significantly associated with loyalty. The impact
                  of trust on loyalty is moderated by uncertainty avoidance. As
                  such, culture is an explanatory variable for customer loyalty.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: The current moment is characterised by deep-rooted
                  uncertainties, such as climate change and COVID-19.
                  Uncertainty has been reported to be associated with negative
                  mental health outcomes, such as stress and anxiety. However,
                  no comprehensive review on the association between uncertainty
                  and mental health exists. AIM: The aim of the current scoping
                  review was to systematically explore and describe the
                  literature on the link between uncertainty and mental health.
                  METHODS: A scoping review was undertaken following guidelines
                  by Arksey and O'Malley (2005). RESULTS: One hundred and one
                  papers addressing the association between uncertainty and
                  mental health were identified. Most were cross-sectional
                  studies (67\%) conducted in the fields of medicine or nursing
                  (59\%), in high-income countries, among adult populations
                  (74\%), and in medical settings. Substantial heterogeneity was
                  identified in the measurements of uncertainty and mental
                  health. Most studies (79\%) reported a positive association
                  between uncertainty and mental health problems. CONCLUSIONS:
                  Research is needed in more diverse contexts and populations.
                  More robust designs are required to provide insight into the
                  directionality and strength of the association between
                  uncertainty and mental health. Few studies reported how
                  individuals coped with uncertainty. Future studies should
                  address the identified gaps and investigate interventions to
                  address uncertainty and its determinants.},

                  happened or is going to happen is typically depicted as
                  undesirable, and people often seek to minimize and avoid it.
                  Research has shown that having a negative attitude toward
                  uncertainty is associated with poor mental health and that
                  certainty seeking can lead to accepting meager rewards and
                  low-quality information. As a remedy for negative views of
                  uncertainty, the present review discusses the functions of
                  some typical responses to uncertainty as well as research on
                  circumstances in which uncertainty can be leveraged to improve
                  well-being. Uncertainty can focus attention, increase effort,
                  and increase the intensity and duration of positive effect.
                  Recognizing that there are situations in which uncertainty is
                  desirable may be a first step toward improving attitudes
                  toward uncertainty.},

                  day. In each case, there are a multitude of unknowns,
                  reflecting the many sources of uncertainty inherent to social
                  inference. We describe how uncertainty manifests in social
                  environments (the thoughts and intentions of others are
                  largely hidden, making it difficult to predict a person's
                  behaviour) and why people are motivated to reduce the aversive
                  feelings generated by uncertainty. We propose a three-part
                  model whereby social uncertainty is initially reduced through
                  automatic modes of inference (such as impression formation)
                  before more control-demanding modes of inference (such as
                  perspective-taking) are deployed to narrow one's predictions
                  even more. Finally, social uncertainty is attenuated further
                  through learning processes that update these predictions based
                  on new information. Our framework integrates research across
                  fields to offer an account of the mechanisms motivating social
                  cognition and action, laying the groundwork for future
                  experiments that can illuminate the impact of uncertainty on

                  that individuals choose among risky prospects by balancing the
                  value of the possible consequences. These models, therefore,
                  require that the value of a risky prospect lie between the
                  value of that prospect's highest and lowest outcome. Although
                  this requirement seems essential for any theory of risky
                  decision-making, we document a violation of this condition in
                  which individuals value a risky prospect less than its worst
                  possible realization. This demonstration, which we term the
                  uncertainty effect, draws from more than 1000 experimental
                  participants, and includes hypothetical and real pricing and

                  We propose that indeterminacy is a key reason. Indeterminate
                  consumption experiences (such as watching sports competitions
                  live on television) unfold in ways that are not decided ex
                  ante. This makes them more exciting than equivalent
                  determinate experiences (such as watching recorded
                  broadcasts). We offer empirical evidence for this proposition:
                  independently of other differences between live and taped
                  broadcasts, the indeterminacy of events made watching them
                  live more exciting and correspondingly preferable. We conclude
                  by discussing implications of the indeterminacy concept for
                  consumer research.},

                  Instagram. The results from a sample of 191 Instagram users
                  revealed that more frequent creative use of Instagram was
                  related to greater engagement in everyday creative behaviors,
                  creative self‐beliefs, the openness facet of creative

                  morality in consumer psychology over the years, such
                  investigations often fail to (a) recognize the different
                  values that consumers might hold, and (b) provide proper
                  context for why different moral considerations emerge. Moral
                  Foundations Theory (MFT; Graham et al., Advances in
                  experimental social psychology, 2013, Academic Press; Haidt \&
                  Joseph, Daedalus, 2004, 133, 55) provides just such a
                  conceptual framework for understanding the diversity of moral
                  thought that exists across cultures and demographic groups.
                  MFT describes morality not as a monolithic entity, but as a
                  pluralistic set of intuitive values that were shaped by
                  evolutionary pressures and edited by distinct cultures. We
                  review the central claims of MFT and describe how the theory
                  can offer new insights when applied to consumer psychology,
                  providing examples from existing research on persuasion,

                  universal means of expressing our emotions, feelings, and
                  beliefs. This work investigates the link between our moral
                  values and musical choices through lyrics and audio analyses.
                  We align the psychometric scores of 1,480 participants to
                  acoustics and lyrics features obtained from the top 5 songs of
                  their preferred music artists from Facebook Page Likes. We
                  employ a variety of lyric text processing techniques,
                  including lexicon-based approaches and BERT-based embeddings,
                  to identify each song's narrative, moral valence, attitude,
                  and emotions. In addition, we extract both low- and high-level
                  audio features to comprehend the encoded information in
                  participants' musical choices and improve the moral
                  inferences. We propose a Machine Learning approach and assess
                  the predictive power of lyrical and acoustic features
                  separately and in a multimodal framework for predicting moral
                  values. Results indicate that lyrics and audio features from
                  the artists people like inform us about their morality. Though
                  the most predictive features vary per moral value, the models
                  that utilised a combination of lyrics and audio
                  characteristics were the most successful in predicting moral
                  values, outperforming the models that only used basic features
                  such as user demographics, the popularity of the artists, and
                  the number of likes per user. Audio features boosted the
                  accuracy in the prediction of empathy and equality compared to
                  textual features, while the opposite happened for hierarchy
                  and tradition, where higher prediction scores were driven by
                  lyrical features. This demonstrates the importance of both
                  lyrics and audio features in capturing moral values. The
                  insights gained from our study have a broad range of potential
                  uses, including customising the music experience to meet
                  individual needs, music rehabilitation, or even effective
                  communication campaign crafting.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety disorders have a high
                  disease burden and as many as 15\% of young people report
                  mental health problems. Binge drinking, which is a
                  particularly harmful way of consuming alcohol, is common among
                  secondary school students. The aim of this study was to
                  examine the association between binge drinking and
                  self-reported mental health in boys and girls aged 12 to 18
                  years. FINDINGS: This cross-sectional analysis was performed
                  on data collected by the Community Health Service (GGD)
                  Brabant Zuidoost, the Netherlands, in 2007. In this Youth
                  Survey, 10 090 randomly selected adolescents aged 12 tot 18
                  years were each sent a letter, a questionnaire, and a user
                  name and log-in code for if they preferred to complete the
                  Internet version of the questionnaire. Mental health was
                  assessed using the Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5), a short
                  5-item questionnaire to detect feelings of depression and
                  anxiety. Participants were asked about current alcohol
                  consumption, their relationship with their parents, drug use,
                  and sociodemographic data.Corrected for confounders, binge
                  drinking and mental health problems were associated in the 12
                  to 15 year old girls (OR 2.43; 95\% CI 1.86-3.17, p = 0.000)
                  and boys (OR 1.64, 95\% CI 1.19-2.27, p = 0.003). The majority
                  of the 16 to 18 year old adolescents had been binge drinking
                  in the previous 4 weeks (69.6\% boys and 56.8\% girls). In
                  this age group, boys with mental health problems were less
                  likely to be classified as binge drinkers than were boys
                  without mental health problems (OR 0.63, 95\% CI 0.45-0.87, p
                  = 0.005). No such association between binge drinking and
                  mental health was found in girls of this age. CONCLUSION:
                  Girls and boys aged 12-15 years were classified as binge
                  drinkers significantly more often when they reported poor
                  mental health. Because binge drinking damages the brain,
                  especially at a young age, it is important that health
                  professionals are alert to possible binge drinking when young
                  adolescents report mental health problems and should ask their
                  patients about their drinking behaviour. Likewise, if
                  youngsters under 16 present with binge drinking, they should
                  be asked whether they are anxious or depressed.},

                  else. To avoid conceptual and empirical confusion, researchers

                  transformative technology since the Industrial Revolution. As
                  AI is integrated into different domains of life, it is likely
                  to also permeate politics. In fact, some voices already
                  advocate for AI to make political decisions. This paper
                  emphasizes the necessity to delve into the psychosocial
                  determinants shaping support for supporting a technocracy of
                  AI (TecAI). The research aims to ascertain whether anomie,
                  moderated by NCC and SDO, predicts support for TecAI across
                  three studies involving Spanish participants (Ntotal = 754).
                  The findings confirm anomie's predictive power on support of
                  TecAI, albeit without establishing causality consistently, as
                  anomie's condition failed to alter support for TecAI in
                  experiments 2 and 3. However, an exploratory analysis showed a
                  small effect of the subdimension of “breakdown of leadership”
                  on support for TecAI in a directional test, informing future
                  research. Moreover, NCC and SDO did not significantly moderate
                  the anomie‐support‐for‐TecAI link. Ideology also emerged as a
                  consistent predictor, with conservatives consistently showing
                  more support, a finding that ought to be re‐examined and
                  clarified. This study marks an initial empirical exploration
                  into AI's political perceptions, hinting at the need for

                  for mental and physical well‐being. Despite its social nature,
                  evidence on how loneliness affects social behaviours and
                  expectations is lacking. Using Bayesian analyses and economic
                  games, we show in three different studies that lonelier
                  individuals trusted their partners to a greater extent despite
                  less favourable trustworthiness expectations, showing a
                  greater discrepancy between their trusting behaviours and
                  their expectations of others' trustworthiness. Such
                  discrepancy was reversed in extravert individuals who also
                  reported to be less lonely. These results provide evidence on
                  two opposing effects of loneliness as a motivator for social
                  connections and promoter of social withdrawal, and demonstrate
                  the moderating role of personality traits. This work
                  contributes to a better understanding of how loneliness
                  impacts social behaviour and social expectations, with
                  important downstream clinical implications for varying health
                  conditions associated with heightened feelings of loneliness.},

                  worldwide. However, does valuing happiness lead to better

                  happiness on well-being using a population-based longitudinal
                  survey of Dutch adults ( N = 8,331) from 2019 to 2023.
                  Random-intercept cross-lagged panel models indicated that
                  those who valued happiness generally exhibited higher
                  well-being as manifested by life satisfaction, more positive
                  affect, and less negative affect. However, increases in
                  valuing happiness did not result in changes in life
                  satisfaction 1 year later and had mixed emotional consequences
                  (i.e., increasing both positive and negative affect).
                  Additional analyses using fixed-effects models indicated that
                  valuing happiness had contemporaneous positive effects on
                  well-being. These findings indicate that endorsing happiness
                  goals may have immediate psychological benefits but may not
                  necessarily translate into long-term positive outcomes.},

                  how can one establish and maintain an environment that fosters
                  successful collaboration within a research group? In this case
                  study, I use my own experience when directing the ABC Research
                  Group at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in
                  Berlin. I first describe the heuristic principles for setting
                  up a research group, including (i) common topic and multiple
                  disciplines, (ii) open culture, (iii) spatial proximity, and
                  (iv) temporal proximity. Then I describe heuristics for
                  maintaining the open culture, such as setting collective
                  goals, including contrarians, distributing responsibility,
                  making bets, the cake rule, and side-by-side writing. These
                  heuristics form an "adaptive toolbox" that shapes the

                  friendly but rigorous discussion, embedded in a family-like
                  climate of trust where everyone is willing to expose their
                  ignorance and learn from the other members. Feeling accepted
                  and trusted encourages taking the necessary risks to achieve
                  progress in science.},

                  research to address why consumers develop strong attachments

                  persona who is the subject of marketing communications
                  efforts. Study 1 uses a survey that is analyzed with
                  structural equation modeling. Study 2 is qualitative and
                  offers corroborating evidence for the proposed theoretical
                  model. Study 3 extends the model with a more naturalistic
                  sample and tests several alternative hypotheses using
                  hierarchical regression. The results suggest that when a human
                  brand enhances a person's feelings of autonomy and relatedness
                  and does not suppress feelings of competence, the person is
                  likely to become more strongly attached to it. This article
                  documents that strong attachments are predictive of satisfied,

                  attachment strength may be a parsimonious proxy for
                  consumer–brand relationship strength. The results imply that
                  benefits would accrue to organizations such as entertainment
                  firms and political parties that establish direct and routine
                  interaction between human brands and consumers, that human
                  brands to which consumers are attached offer significant
                  potential as endorsers, and that organizations should address

  abstract     = {As reflected in the amount of controversy, few areas in
                  psychology have undergone such dramatic conceptual changes in
                  the past decade as the emerging science of heuristics.
                  Heuristics are efficient cognitive processes, conscious or
                  unconscious, that ignore part of the information. Because
                  using heuristics saves effort, the classical view has been
                  that heuristic decisions imply greater errors than do
                  "rational" decisions as defined by logic or statistical
                  models. However, for many decisions, the assumptions of
                  rational models are not met, and it is an empirical rather
                  than an a priori issue how well cognitive heuristics function
                  in an uncertain world. To answer both the descriptive question
                  ("Which heuristics do people use in which situations?") and
                  the prescriptive question ("When should people rely on a given
                  heuristic rather than a complex strategy to make better
                  judgments?"), formal models are indispensable. We review
                  research that tests formal models of heuristic inference,
                  including in business organizations, health care, and legal
                  institutions. This research indicates that (a) individuals and
                  organizations often rely on simple heuristics in an adaptive
                  way, and (b) ignoring part of the information can lead to more
                  accurate judgments than weighting and adding all information,
                  for instance for low predictability and small samples. The big
                  future challenge is to develop a systematic theory of the
                  building blocks of heuristics as well as the core capacities
                  and environmental structures these exploit.},

                  creative performance, like any goal‐oriented action, requires
                  understanding and managing one's own cognitive processes –
                  thus, efficient metacognition. Recently, a systematic
                  framework of creative metacognition (CMC) has been proposed,
                  assuming the relevance of metacognitive knowledge, monitoring,
                  and control in creative performance. Here, we provide the
                  first comprehensive empirical examination of this conception.
                  Specifically, an online sample (N = 425) performed divergent
                  thinking (DT) tasks and gave insight in relevant aspects of
                  metacognitive processes during task performance. The study
                  revealed that all three proposed components of CMC played
                  independent roles in enhancing creative cognitive performance,
                  including divergent thinking creativity and fluency. Among
                  these components, metacognitive control showed the strongest
                  positive association with creative cognitive performance. As
                  expected, CMC was especially relevant to imminent creative
                  task performance but showed some association with real‐life
                  creativity. These findings provide the first empirical
                  evidence that all three postulated components of CMC support
                  creative performance and, to a lesser degree, to creative
                  behavior. In the discussion, we delve deeper into the specific
                  roles of these metacognitive subcomponents in enhancing
                  creative cognitive performance and touch upon the differences
                  between the roles of self‐regulation and metacognition in
                  creativity.},

                  uncertainty, consumers with a relatively stronger global
                  (local) identity prefer local (global) brands. This effect
                  occurs because uncertainty (certainty) activates a divergent
                  (convergent) thinking style, which results in a preference for
                  options that are more distant from (closer to) the identity to
                  which consumers associate more strongly. The effect holds both

                  measured and when it is manipulated. The research further
                  establishes an important boundary condition for the effect.
                  The effect holds in the citizenship identity context because
                  people normally associate themselves with both local and
                  global citizenship identities, and situational or
                  dispositional factors only influence the degree to which they

                  individuals construe their local–global citizenship identities
                  as interfering, meaning they conceive that holding one
                  identity conflicts with holding the other.},

  abstract     = {The stereotypes content model indicates that two traits (i.e.,
                  warmth and competence) govern individuals' impression
                  formation. The great variety of research that has used this
                  theory since the early 2000s leads to a need for a structured
                  overview of prior findings. The goal of this study is to
                  provide a concise map of research streams and present a
                  research agenda. We conducted a systematic literature review
                  of 955 articles. A bibliographic coupling analysis showed four
                  clusters, i.e., (1) the general theoretical foundations of the
                  SCM, (2) the societal impact of key stereotypes (with emphasis
                  on gender), (3) research in clinical psychology and child
                  development, and (4) marketing. Taking a closer look at
                  research in marketing (using co-occurrence analysis), six
                  research streams were identified, including research on
                  branding, country-of-origin, front-line service providers,
                  prosocial consumer behavior, perception of endorsers, and,
                  more recently, on artificial intelligence (AI). The review
                  presents key findings and research gaps across these topics.
                  Finally, we reviewed the few articles that, although not
                  falling into these streams, opened important research veins.
                  This process provided the essential information to present a
                  promising and complete research agenda, to continue building
                  knowledge with impactful implications in different contexts.},

                  postcognitive, that is, to occur only after considerable
                  cognitive operations have been accomplished. Yet a number of
                  experimental results on preferences, attitudes, impression
                  formation, and decision making, as well as some clinical
                  phenomena, suggest that affective judgments may be fairly
                  independent of, and precede in time, the sorts of perceptual
                  and cognitive operations commonly assumed to be the basis of
                  these affective judgments. Affective reactions to stimuli are
                  often the very first reactions of the organism, and for lower
                  organisms they are the dominant reactions. Affective reactions
                  can occur without extensive perceptual and cognitive encoding,
                  are made with greater confidence than cognitive judgments, and
                  can be made sooner. Experimental evidence is presented
                  demonstrating that reliable affective discriminations
                  (like–dislike ratings) can be made in the total absence of
                  recognition memory (old–new judgments). Various differences
                  between judgments based on affect and those based on
                  perceptual and cognitive processes are examined. It is
                  concluded that affect and cognition are under the control of
                  separate and partially independent systems that can influence
                  each other in a variety of ways, and that both constitute
                  independent sources of effects in information processing. (139

                  identifying the four questions we ask in animal behavior-how
                  does the behavior emerge across the lifespan (development);
                  how does it work (mechanism); how and why did it evolve
                  (evolution); and why is it adaptive (function). Tinbergen
                  clarified that these 'levels of analysis' are complementary,
                  not competing, thereby avoiding many fruitless scientific
                  debates. However, the relationships among the four levels was

                  (encompassing mechanism, development, and evolution) and

                  seamlessly link evolution, development, and mechanism into a
                  continuum of 'causes'. The cause-consequence distinction
                  separates the processes that precede (and lead to) a behavior,
                  from the processes that come after (and result from) a
                  behavior. Even for past behaviors, the functional outcomes are

                  consequences: stereotyping. Participants in this study
                  completed a measure of implicit stereotyping after being
                  exposed to an uncertainty threat or not. They also completed
                  an individual difference measure to tap into their needs for
                  predictability and structure. Results showed that uncertainty
                  threat caused increased stereotyping of an ethnic out-group
                  when needs for predictability and structure were high. For
                  participants who did not have a high level of these needs,

                  comparatively little research exploring presumed behavioral
                  correlates of IU. The current study was designed to assess
                  relationships between self-reported IU and decisions in
                  uncertainty-based behavioral tasks (specifically, the
                  Wisconsin Card Sorting Task, the Risky Gains Task, and the
                  Modified Iowa Gambling Task). Participants comprised
                  compensated community members (n = 108; 69\% women) and
                  undergraduates (n = 98; 78\% women). Community member
                  compensation was not contingent on performance, but
                  undergraduate compensation was partially contingent on
                  performance. Results replicated prior research, with both

                  correlations (ps < .05) between self-reported IU and outcome
                  variables from each of the behavioral tasks. The relationships
                  were larger in the undergraduate sample, likely due to the
                  compensation incentive. In general, the results suggest that
                  increasing IU is associated with increasingly risk adverse
                  behaviors; however, the relationship appears complex and in
                  need of substantial additional research to understand how
                  clinically-significant IU would impact pathology-related

                  the importance of affect in guiding judgments and decisions.
                  As used here, “affect” means the specific quality of
                  “goodness” or “badness” (i) experienced as a feeling state
                  (with or without consciousness) and (ii) demarcating a
                  positive or negative quality of a stimulus. Affective
                  responses occur rapidly and automatically—note how quickly you
                  sense the feelings associated with the stimulus word
                  “treasure” or the word “hate”. We argue that reliance on such
                  feelings can be characterized as “the affect heuristic”. In
                  this paper we trace the development of the affect heuristic
                  across a variety of research paths followed by ourselves and
                  many others. We also discuss some of the important practical
                  implications resulting from ways that this heuristic impacts

                  ability-based pathway suggests that people engage in
                  risk-taking when they possess abilities or traits that
                  increase the probability of successful risk-taking, the
                  expected value of the risky behavior itself, and/or have
                  signaling value. We provide a conceptual model of
                  decision-making under risk-the relative state model-that
                  integrates both pathways and explicates how situational and
                  embodied factors influence the estimated costs and benefits of
                  risk-taking in different contexts. This model may help to
                  reconcile long-standing disagreements and issues regarding the
                  etiology of risk-taking, such as the domain-generality versus
                  domain-specificity of risk or differential engagement in
                  antisocial and non-antisocial risk-taking.},

                  a specific identity group that has yet to be studied in the
                  context of PCH. It also includes gay men as a comparison group
                  for the same processes. Participants ( n = 241) were exposed
                  in a two-condition experiment to either Queer Eye (2018
                  version; gay men as target group) or Tidying Up With Marie
                  Kondo (Asian women as target group). Only social attraction
                  significantly mediated the relationship between exposure to
                  Queer Eye and attitudes toward gay men. Attitudes toward Asian
                  women were measured with positive and negative subscales;
                  social and task attraction significantly mediated a reduction

                  ambivalence effect; it mediated increases in both positive and

  abstract     = {Sharing emotions with other individuals is a widespread
                  phenomenon. Previous research proposed that experiencing
                  intense and similar emotions with other individuals reinforces
                  social bonds. However, several aspects of this phenomenon
                  remain unclear, notably whether social bonding requires the
                  convergence and synchronization of emotions in the group, and
                  whether these effects generalize across positively valenced
                  and negatively valenced emotional contexts. To address these
                  questions, we measured subjective emotional experiences,
                  physiological activity (cardiac, respiratory, electrodermal)
                  and social attitudes in dyads of unacquainted individuals who
                  watched videos in the presence of each other. We manipulated
                  the emotional content of the videos and the type of shared
                  attention between participants, to test for the contribution
                  of interpersonal influence. The results revealed that intense
                  emotions indexed by physiological arousal were associated with
                  the emergence of reciprocal prosocial attitudes within dyads,
                  and that this effect depended on joint attention. We did not
                  observe the convergence and synchronization of emotions within
                  dyads, which suggests that experiencing similar emotions was
                  not necessary for social bonding. We discuss implications of
                  this study for research on collective effervescence and the
                  social consequences of shared experiences.},

                  swiftly beyond all borders and turned into a global source of

                  repeatedly share breaking news to release the latest data of
                  all countries. The consequence of that has been a heightened
                  level of anxiety among humans and opting for unorthodox
                  consumption behaviors as consumers. In this study the attempt
                  was to analyze human behaviors during the ongoing pandemic
                  process from the perspective of psychology and marketing
                  fields of science. In so doing, interrelation among anxiety,
                  which surfaced because of Covid-19 pandemic, coping style with
                  stress of individuals and compulsive purchase behavior has

                  demand from consumers, brands in a wide variety of categories
                  have sought to define, articulate, communicate, and act
                  according to their “brand purpose.” But what is brand purpose?
                  Human purpose is seen as a long‐term commitment to act
                  consistently with one's values, leading to productive
                  engagement with the world that transcends the self. However,
                  the use of the term purpose as applied to brands raises a
                  number of questions. In what ways is brand purpose similar to,
                  and different from, human purpose? How do consumers react to
                  brand purpose? How might a brand's purpose impact consumers?
                  In this review, we explore the concept of brand purpose and
                  its potential impact on consumer behavior, drawing upon the
                  literature on human purpose. Additionally, we propose that
                  engagement and connections with authentically purposeful
                  brands may contribute to consumers' own purposeful lives,
                  ultimately helping consumers achieve their own eudaimonic
                  well‐being. We develop a framework highlighting the
                  relationship between brand purpose and consumer eudaimonic
                  well‐being to guide future research in this domain.},

                  support grows for their social justice goals. At their core,
                  social movements advance when people act collectively by
                  rising in solidarity with a shared purpose to address
                  injustice and inequality. Drawing on insights from consumer
                  psychology, this review investigates how social movements
                  succeed in creating social change. We build on an established
                  21st‐century framework for how social movements succeed to
                  outline the promising practices of successful social
                  movements. For each of these practices, we identify the
                  consumer psychology mechanisms that motivate collective action
                  and encourage people to transform from bystanders
                  toupstanders, those who provide the grassroots momentum for
                  successful social movements. We illustrate this framework with
                  examples from the growth of the Black Lives Matter movement.
                  Finally, we highlight insights from consumer psychology that
                  promote an understanding of social movements, and we raise
                  research questions to encourage more consumer psychologists to
                  investigate how social movements succeed.},

                  value, I present the concept of “Concurrent Experience
                  Evaluation” (“CEE”), which expands the prior focus on
                  experienced pain and pleasure in response to a stimulus/event.
                  Specifically, the value of an experience is also determined by
                  the concurrent (during‐the‐experience) cognitive assessment of
                  the event relative to the person's associated goal
                  progress/regression. CEE can account for during‐the‐experience
                  and subsequent choices that people make. Examples of CEE
                  include cognitive evaluations that enhance the experience
                  value such as “good for me” (while eating kale), “I'm getting
                  my money's worth” (while using a new camera), and “I'm having
                  a cultural experience” (while visiting a museum), or detract
                  from the experience such as “I shouldn't be doing this” (while
                  smoking or overeating) and “should have chosen the other line”
                  (while waiting at the supermarket checkout). Although prior
                  research has examined hedonic experiences and their context
                  (e.g., being with friends, commuting, colonoscopy) as well as
                  what else the mind may process during an experience (e.g.,
                  wandering, thinking of past and future decisions), the
                  concurrent value derived from the cognitive evaluation of the
                  goal implications of an experience has not been identified as
                  a separate experience value component. I examine and
                  illustrate the CEE concept, its determinants, moderators, and
                  implications, as well as its distinctive characteristics as
                  compared with other value perspectives and
                  during‐the‐experience mental processes. Integrating the CEE
                  framework with prior work regarding experience evaluations, I

                  journals (Study 1) and cited in popular textbooks (Study 2)

                  This limited focus might be justified if friends-first

                  the opposite. In a meta-analysis of seven samples of

                  music in sexual attraction (i.e., sex appeal), a hypothesis
                  that has recently gained traction in the field of music
                  psychology. In his writings, Darwin particularly emphasized
                  the charming aspects of music. Across a broad range of
                  cultures, music has a profound impact on humans' feelings,
                  thoughts and behavior. Human mate choice is determined by the
                  interplay of several factors. A number of studies have shown
                  that music and musicality (i.e., the ability to produce and
                  enjoy music) exert a positive influence on the evaluation of
                  potential sexual partners. Here, we critically review the
                  latest empirical literature on how and why music and
                  musicality affect sexual attraction by considering the role of
                  music-induced emotion and arousal in listeners as well as

                  present studies that examine the impact of music and
                  musicality on sexual attraction in different social settings.
                  We differentiate between emotion-based influences related to
                  the subjective experience of music as sound and effects
                  associated with perceived musical ability or creativity in a
                  potential partner. By integrating studies using various
                  behavioral methods, we link current research strands that

                  respond as positively to low‐fit CM initiatives as high‐fit
                  ones. This effect occurs because holistic thinkers focus not
                  only on the company and its characteristics but also on the
                  perceived need of the cause beneficiaries, making them more
                  likely to perceive the corporate motives to be public‐serving,
                  producing more favorable evaluations of the company.
                  Dispositional skepticism toward corporate social
                  responsibility (CSR) acts as a boundary condition of this

                  relationships make between the overall quality of an activity
                  (i.e., experience quality) and the ability to share the
                  activity in physical proximity to a relationship partner
                  (i.e., togetherness). A pilot study and five experiments
                  demonstrate that consumers value togetherness (vs. experience
                  quality) relatively more when they share the experience with a
                  close (vs. distant) relationship partner. Importantly, this
                  work documents a novel mechanism underlying the value that
                  consumers place on togetherness: a desire to create shared
                  memories. Supportive of this mechanism, the extent to which
                  consumers value togetherness (vs. experience quality) is
                  increased when outcomes for the self and the partner are
                  asymmetrical (vs. symmetrical) if choosing to be apart and is
                  reduced when the experience is framed as utilitarian (vs.
                  hedonic) and when consumers are reminded that they can create
                  shared memories even when apart. Taken together, this work
                  extends previous research on shared consumption by documenting
                  a desire to create shared memories as a novel driver of
                  consumer decision‐making in the context of close
                  relationships.},

                  large-scale, population-based study of adults, we applied
                  network analysis to study the relationship between
                  environmental factors and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and
                  well-being. We estimated networks with overall mental health

                  fine-grained associations between environmental factors and
                  mental health. Finally, we conducted an out-of-sample
                  replication in an independent large-scale sample to assess the
                  robustness of our results. Across 31,000 adults randomly
                  sampled from the Norwegian population, we identified
                  associations between numerous environmental characteristics
                  and mental health. Recent discrimination and unsupportive
                  social environments were strongly associated with lower
                  population well-being and higher levels of mental illness
                  symptoms, respectively. The most strongly connected variables
                  in the networks were environmental factors, including
                  perceived problems with crime, violence, or vandalism in the
                  residential area, worrying about violence or threats when
                  outside, and problems with noise or contamination at home.
                  Substantial variation in population mental health was
                  explained by environmental factors included in the networks.
                  Replicability of the results was excellent and suggestive of
                  strong robustness of the results across samples. Our findings
                  are indicative of the importance of environmental factors,

                  answers to this question are unknown, despite a significant
                  push toward greater gender diversity on committees and boards.
                  This article uncovers the mechanism of if and how committees’
                  gender diversity impacts its deliberations and decisions. We
                  utilize a unique dataset that matches detailed meeting
                  transcripts of the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market
                  Committee (FOMC) spanning over 30 years, with member
                  characteristics and economy-wide conditions, allowing us to
                  effectively compare committees with the same member resources
                  and economy-wide conditions but different gender diversity. We
                  find that deliberations are more thorough and engaged in more
                  gender-balanced committees, wherein both men and women talk
                  more about wider topics in depth. Unlike findings from other
                  studies, women in the FOMC participate as active members,
                  whereby they are more likely to voice formal disagreement and
                  less likely to be dismissed by an interruption. Finally, we
                  find that member resources and the economy-wide conditions
                  explain the committee’s decision, where gender diversity
                  exhibits no explanatory power by and in itself. With the high
                  correlation between gender diversity and member resources, we

                  goal pursuit. In a standard-reward condition, we
                  experimentally offered gym members an individual cash reward
                  each day they visited the gym for four weeks. Participants in

                  if they surmounted an extra logistical hurdle: they had to

                  participants with this extra hurdle visited the gym about 35\%

                  perception, likely because of increased sensitivity to
                  acoustic cues, such as fundamental frequency (F0) and timbre.
                  Yet, how musicians make use of these acoustic cues to perceive
                  emotions, and how they might differ from non-musicians, is
                  unclear. To address these points, we created vocal stimuli
                  that conveyed happiness, fear, pleasure or sadness, either in
                  all acoustic cues, or selectively in either F0 or timbre only.
                  We then compared vocal emotion perception performance between
                  professional/semi-professional musicians (N = 39) and
                  non-musicians (N = 38), all socialized in Western music
                  culture. Compared to non-musicians, musicians classified vocal
                  emotions more accurately. This advantage was seen in the full
                  and F0-modulated conditions, but was absent in the
                  timbre-modulated condition indicating that musicians excel at
                  perceiving the melody (F0), but not the timbre of vocal
                  emotions. Further, F0 seemed more important than timbre for
                  the recognition of all emotional categories. Additional
                  exploratory analyses revealed a link between time-varying F0
                  perception in music and voices that was independent of musical
                  training. Together, these findings suggest that musicians are
                  particularly tuned to the melody of vocal emotions, presumably
                  due to a natural predisposition to exploit melodic patterns.},

                  scope of research on the role of mental time travel in
                  bolstering the self. We propose that imagining the self in the
                  future (prospection) or in the past (retrospection) highlights
                  central and positive self-aspects. Thus, bringing to mind
                  one's future or past broadens the perceived bases of
                  self-integrity and offers a route to self-affirmation. In
                  reviewing corresponding research programs on self-prospection
                  and nostalgia, we illustrate that mental time travel serves to
                  affirm the self in terms of self-esteem, coherence, and
                  control. Mental time travel could be implemented as a source
                  of self-affirmation for facilitating coping and behavior
                  change in several domains such as relationships, health,
                  education, and organizational contexts. PUBLIC ABSTRACT:
                  People can mentally travel to their future or to their past.
                  When people imagine what they will be like in the future, or
                  what they were like in the past, they tend to think about
                  themselves in terms of the important and positive attributes
                  that they possess. Thinking about themselves in such an
                  affirming way expands and consolidates their self-views. This
                  broader image of themselves can increase self-esteem (the
                  extent to which one likes who they are), coherence (the extent
                  to which one perceives life as meaningful), and control (the
                  extent to which one feels capable of initiating and pursuing
                  goals or effecting desirable outcomes). Mental time travel,
                  then, has favorable or affirming consequences for one's
                  self-views. These consequences can be harnessed to modify
                  one's behavior in such life domains as relationships, health,
                  education, and work.},

                  of race and the continued discomfort about what role it plays
                  in the structure of inequality, I endeavor to clarify the
                  origins of the association of race with skin color and other
                  physical features by briefly discussing the historical record
                  by which race became codified in law. My focus is the U.S. and
                  specifically Colonial Virginia, where the codification of
                  racial categories in law was especially consequential. I also
                  discuss the existence of a racial hierarchy in which Whites
                  are dominant and Nonwhites of various types are subordinate. I
                  argue that the continued existence of this racial hierarchy
                  not only has a legacy from the past, but it is reproduced in
                  the present and continues to have major effects on the life
                  chances of those thought of as belonging to different racial
                  groups. I also discuss the elasticity, ambiguity, and
                  contested nature of racial classifications, as well as the
                  internal differentiation among those thought to belong to the
                  same racial groups and the changes and variations over time
                  that are continually remaking the meaning of race. Because of
                  the political significance of race, I also clarify the meaning
                  of key concepts that have been receiving recent attention:
                  White privilege, White supremacy, and White colorblindness.
                  Finally, I discuss race as a process rather than as a
                  classification and briefly discuss how Whites and men can
                  become allies, advocates, and activists in support of social
                  justice.},

  abstract     = {Informal advice relations across units in an organization are
                  beneficial for knowledge sharing and problem solving. Prior
                  research suggests that despite their benefits, there are costs
                  to informal advice relations across units. However, the
                  mechanisms by which these costs are mitigated remain unclear.
                  We theorize that this lack of clarity is because work factors
                  have not been sufficiently considered. We examine one such
                  work factor, specifically time pressure, and develop a
                  cost-based explanation for how time pressure influences
                  cross-unit advice relationships. We investigate two
                  time-pressure levels. In the first, work is conducted under
                  lower time pressure, and there is less likelihood of a
                  negative outcome. In the second, work is conducted under
                  higher time-pressure conditions, and there is a greater
                  likelihood of a negative outcome. We theorize that under lower
                  time-pressure conditions, the costs of advice relations across
                  units are mitigated by reciprocal advice relationships.
                  However, under higher time pressure, the cost of informal
                  advice relations across units is higher owing to the need for
                  quick coordination of advice, and these costs are mitigated by
                  reciprocal advice relationships in conjunction with cross-unit
                  formal workflow relationships. To test our hypotheses, we
                  examine the informal advice network and formal workflow
                  network in lower and higher time-pressure conditions among 118
                  members of the Information Technology and Systems division of
                  a Formula One racing team. Our results indicate that under
                  lower time-pressure conditions, reciprocal advice ties are
                  sufficient to overcome costs. However, under higher
                  time-pressure conditions, cross-unit advice ties are
                  facilitated by reciprocal advice ties embedded in the workflow
                  ties between units. Thus, our findings have implications for
                  how knowledge is managed and how problems are solved in
                  organizations.},

                  a particular image, has been shown to be an intrinsic property
                  of the image that is distinct from many other visual and
                  cognitive features. Research thus far has not identified
                  particular visual features that can sufficiently explain this
                  intrinsic memorability, but one possibility is that more and
                  less memorable images differ in their statistical regularity
                  (i.e., how prototypical or distinctive they are). Statistical
                  regularity is known to affect detection time for images, such
                  that stimuli with higher statistical regularity can be
                  detected with shorter presentation directions. Therefore, in
                  the present study, we probed whether memorability affects how
                  quickly an image can be detected. High- and low-memorability
                  images were presented in an intact/scrambled task wherein
                  participants were asked to indicate whether they saw an intact
                  image or noise, and we estimated the presentation duration
                  necessary for participants to reach 70.7\% accuracy. Across
                  two experiments using different stimulus materials, we
                  observed and then replicated that more memorable images are
                  associated with shorter detection thresholds than those for
                  less memorable images. The results support the idea that
                  memorable stimuli may better match stored templates used for
                  image perception and/or recognition. (PsycInfo Database Record

                  We present two preregistered meta-analyses synthesizing
                  cognitive effects and correlates of reading fiction. In
                  Meta-Analysis 1 (371 effect sizes/70 experiments), reading

                  0.14, 95\% confidence interval (CI) [0.06, 0.21]. This effect
                  of fiction reading was moderated by the comparison group
                  (effects were greater when reading fiction was compared with
                  watching fiction or reading nothing than when reading fiction
                  was compared with reading nonfiction) and the outcome variable
                  (significant effects emerged for empathy and mentalizing
                  only). In Meta-Analysis 2 (559 effect sizes/114 studies
                  reporting correlations), lifetime exposure to print fiction
                  was linked with significant small-sized cognitive benefits, r
                  = .16, 95\% CI [0.13, 0.19]. This effect was moderated by
                  outcome variable (effects were greatest for verbal abilities,
                  followed by general cognitive abilities and
                  empathy/mentalizing/outgroup judgments), fictionality of the

                  nonfiction), publication status (published work exhibited
                  greater effects than unpublished work), type of assessment
                  measure (larger effects emerged when neither the outcome nor
                  print exposure were assessed via self-report, than when either
                  the outcome or print exposure were assessed via self-report),
                  participant group (community samples showed greater effects
                  than student samples), study design (greater effects were
                  found for correlational than for experimental designs), and
                  percentage of female participants (via a negative relationship
                  with cognitive benefits). Together, these meta-analyses
                  provide robust evidence for a small-sized positive
                  relationship between reading fiction and cognitive benefits.

                  critical role that agency plays in the human condition, little
                  is known about its neural basis. A novel theory proposes that
                  increases in agency disinhibit the dopamine system and thereby
                  increase the number of tonically active dopamine neurons in
                  the ventral tegmental area. The theory, called ADDS (Agency
                  Disinhibits the Dopamine System), proposes a specific neural
                  network that mediates these effects. ADDS accurately predicts
                  a variety of relevant neuroscience results, and makes many
                  novel predictions, including that increases in an agency will
                  (a) increase motivation, (b) improve executive function, (c)

                  Furthermore, there is a debate regarding whether originality

                  study examines the association between DT, personality, and
                  classical music listening. There were 162 Malaysian adults who
                  participated in this experiment. Participants were randomly
                  allocated to either happy, sad classical music (i.e., listen
                  to a repeated clip of happy or sad music), or silent
                  conditions (i.e., no music was played). DT and personality
                  were assessed with Figural and Realistic DT Tests and 44-item
                  personality model with five broad factors, respectively.
                  Positive intercorrelations were found between fluency,

  abstract     = {A central part of singing includes learning new pieces of
                  vocal music. Learning a new song is a complex task that
                  involves several functions and modalities, such as memory
                  functions, language and motor skills, and auditory and visual
                  perception. Memory functions are a well-studied area, but it
                  is unknown how memory theories apply to a multimodal activity
                  such as singing. In this study, an attempt is made to
                  translate the theories to the applied field of singing. This
                  study aims to investigate the effectiveness of three types of
                  learning formats for learning new song lyrics: auditory
                  learning with image support (AI), auditory learning with text
                  support (AT), and auditory learning only (A). Ninety-five
                  participants were randomly assigned to one of the three
                  experimental conditions. A univariate analysis of variance
                  revealed a significant effect of condition on the lyric recall
                  score and post-hoc tests showed that participants performed
                  significantly better in the AI condition in comparison to both
                  the AT and the A condition. No significant difference was
                  found between AT and A. This study sheds light on how memory
                  processes might work in learning song lyrics. Practical
                  implications for practitioners such as music educators,
                  conductors, and choir singers are discussed.},

                  people often base their impressions on whole persons (i.e.,
                  faces and bodies). Yet, perceptions of whole persons remain
                  critically underresearched. We address this knowledge gap by
                  testing the relative contributions of faces and bodies to
                  various fundamental social judgments. Results show that faces
                  and bodies contribute different amounts to particular social
                  judgments on orthogonal axes of social perception: Bodies
                  primarily influence status and ability judgments, whereas
                  faces primarily influence warmth-related evaluations. One
                  possible reason for this may be differences in signal that
                  bodies and faces provide for judgments along these two axes.
                  To test this, we extended our investigation to social judgment
                  accuracy, given that signal is a precondition to accuracy.
                  Focusing on one kind of status/ability judgment-impressions of
                  social class standing-we found that perceivers can discern
                  individuals' social class standing from faces, bodies, and
                  whole persons. Conditions that included bodies returned higher
                  accuracy, indicating that bodies may contain more signal to
                  individuals' social class than faces do. Within bodies, shape
                  cued social class more than details of individuals' clothing.
                  Altogether, these findings highlight the importance of the
                  body for fully understanding processes and outcomes in person
                  perception. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights

                  lessons from ParticipACTION, a Canadian non-profit health
                  promotion organization, to examine one of their most
                  well-known campaigns, Body Break with ParticipACTION, in order
                  to assess the potential role for nostalgia-based marketing
                  campaigns in sport participation across generational
                  cohorts.Design/methodology/approachExploratory sequential
                  mixed methods involving two studies were completed on behalf
                  of ParticipACTION, with the authors developing the research
                  instruments and the collection of the data undertaken by
                  research agencies. Study 1 was the secondary analysis of
                  qualitative data from five focus groups with different
                  demographic compositions that followed a common question
                  guide. Study 2 was a secondary data analysis of a pan-Canadian
                  online survey with a sample (n = 1,475) representative of the
                  overall adult population that assessed awareness of, and
                  attitudes toward, ParticipACTION, Body Break, physical
                  activity and sport participation. Path analysis tested a
                  proposed model that was based on previous research on
                  attitudes, brand and loyalty. Further, multi-group path
                  analyses were conducted to compare younger generations with
                  older ones.FindingsThe results provide direction and
                  understanding of the importance of nostalgia in marketing
                  sport participation programs across generational cohorts. For
                  instance, in the four parent-adult focus groups, unaided
                  references as well as frequent and detailed comments regarding
                  Body Break were observed. Similarly, Millennials reported that
                  Body Break was memorable, Canadian and nostalgic, with a mix
                  of positive and negative comments. The importance of nostalgia
                  was supported sequentially via results from the national
                  survey. For example, while 54.1\% of the 40–54 age-group
                  associated ParticipACTION positively with Body Break, so did
                  49.8\% of the 25–39-year age group, most of whom were not born
                  when the promotion ran. Further, brand resonance was found to
                  explain 4\% more variance in moderate-to-vigorous physical
                  activity (MVPA), the proxy for sport participation, for
                  younger people compared to older people.Practical
                  implicationsResults provide direction to brands, properties
                  and agencies around the use of nostalgia in sport marketing
                  campaigns and sponsorship efforts. For brands seeking to
                  sponsor sport properties to alter their image with potential
                  consumers in a new market, associating with a sport property
                  that many view as nostalgic could improve the impact of the
                  campaign. On the sport property side, event managers and
                  marketers should both identify existing assets that members or
                  fans are nostalgic about, as well as consider building
                  nostalgia into current and new properties they
                  develop.Originality/valueThis research is valuable to the
                  sport marketing and sponsorship literature through several
                  contributions. First, the use of nostalgia marketing, and
                  nostalgia in general, is novel in the sport marketing and
                  sponsorship literature, with future research in nostalgia and
                  sponsorship recommended. Second, the potential to adopt or
                  adapt Body Break to other sport participation and physical
                  activity properties is empirically supported. Finally, the
                  finding that very effective promotions can have a long-lasting
                  effect, both on those who experienced the campaigns as well as
                  younger populations who only heard about it, is notable.},

                  children or many organizational samples are excluded. Authors
                  of notable reviews on creativity in organizational settings
                  have noted that they were unable to find adequately conducted
                  and reported studies using genuine intervention designs at the
                  individual, team, or organizational level, raising the
                  question: is creativity training research in organizational
                  settings lacking rigor, visibility, or just lacking? In this
                  meta‐analysis, we examine creativity training effectiveness
                  using Kirkpatrick's four levels of evaluation (reactions,
                  learning, behavior, results) and moderators reflecting study
                  rigor and training delivery/content. Results indicate that
                  training is effective overall (g = 0.68) and for learning
                  outcomes (g = 0.73). However, effects are nonsignificant for
                  on‐the‐job behavior/transfer outcomes (g = 0.34). All
                  moderator analyses were nonsignificant except for timing of
                  outcome evaluation. Studies with a delayed assessment showed a
                  significantly smaller training effect (g = 0.40) than did
                  studies with an immediate assessment (g = 0.86). These results
                  indicate that rigorous creativity training research in
                  organizational settings with behavioral outcomes measured
                  after a delay is lacking. We discuss implications for future
                  research and practical implications for creativity training.},

                  articles—indicate that our index proxies for movements in
                  policy-related economic uncertainty. Our U.S. index spikes
                  near tight presidential elections, Gulf Wars I and II, the
                  9/11 attacks, the failure of Lehman Brothers, the 2011 debt
                  ceiling dispute, and other major battles over fiscal policy.
                  Using firm-level data, we find that policy uncertainty is
                  associated with greater stock price volatility and reduced
                  investment and employment in policy-sensitive sectors like
                  defense, health care, finance, and infrastructure
                  construction. At the macro level, innovations in policy
                  uncertainty foreshadow declines in investment, output, and
                  employment in the United States and, in a panel vector
                  autoregressive setting, for 12 major economies. Extending our
                  U.S. index back to 1900, EPU rose dramatically in the 1930s
                  (from late 1931) and has drifted upward since the 1960s.},

                  for a novel theory of affective reactions to uncertain
                  situations, from which we derive five interrelated hypotheses.
                  The theory holds that people’s past experiences, both long-
                  and short-term, inform their expectations for future outcomes,
                  particularly when the specific outcomes in a situation are
                  unknown. More positive past experiences lead to positive
                  expectations and hence positive affective reactions and
                  approach behaviors related to uncertainty, and more negative
                  past experiences lead to negative expectations and hence
                  negative affective reactions and avoidance behaviors related
                  to uncertainty. While short-term outcomes dominate future
                  expectations in their immediate aftermath, long-term outcomes
                  lead to more stable dispositional optimism or pessimism. In
                  the present article, we describe how this theory explains much
                  prior research on intolerance of uncertainty in several
                  psychological fields, as well as how it can inform
                  interventions aimed at attenuating the negative effects of
                  intolerance of uncertainty, which range from anxiety disorders

                  tried to uncover the impact of the openness-to-experience

                  found in every known human culture. Individuals demonstrate
                  manifestly different preferences in music, and yet relatively
                  little is known about the underlying structure of those
                  preferences. Here, we introduce a model of musical preferences
                  based on listeners' affective reactions to excerpts of music
                  from a wide variety of musical genres. The findings from 3
                  independent studies converged to suggest that there exists a
                  latent 5-factor structure underlying music preferences that is
                  genre free and reflects primarily emotional/affective
                  responses to music. We have interpreted and labeled these
                  factors as (a) a Mellow factor comprising smooth and relaxing
                  styles; (b) an Unpretentious factor comprising a variety of
                  different styles of sincere and rootsy music such as is often
                  found in country and singer-songwriter genres; (c) a
                  Sophisticated factor that includes classical, operatic, world,
                  and jazz; (d) an Intense factor defined by loud, forceful, and
                  energetic music; and (e) a Contemporary factor defined largely
                  by rhythmic and percussive music, such as is found in rap,
                  funk, and acid jazz. The findings from a fourth study suggest
                  that preferences for the MUSIC factors are affected by both
                  the social and the auditory characteristics of the music.},

                  Since Japan is the second largest music market globally, it is
                  surprising that there is little focus on those factors often
                  examined in cross-cultural research that might mean Western
                  findings do not extrapolate well. A questionnaire using
                  established measures of tightness–looseness, relational
                  mobility, and ideal affect was used to test three main
                  research questions. RQ1 was that there should be a
                  relationship between cultural dimensions and musical taste,
                  and this was fully supported. RQ2 was that cultural dimensions
                  should relate to participants’ goals of music consumption, and
                  this was largely supported. RQ3 was that there should be a

                  several more specific research questions concerning how
                  specific uses of music ought to relate to specific cultural
                  dimensions. The findings of the study help us better
                  understand the way music is consumed in relation to specific
                  cultural dimensions in the context of Japan and beyond. It
                  also extends the literature concerning music and
                  cross-cultural psychology where prior research has not
                  considered these dimensions within the context of music

  abstract     = {Moral rules come with exceptions, and moral judgments come
                  with uncertainty. For instance, stealing is wrong and
                  generally punished. Yet, it could be the case that the thief
                  is stealing food for their family. Such information about the
                  thief's context could flip admonishment to praise. To varying
                  degrees, this type of uncertainty regarding the context of
                  another person's behavior is ever-present in moral judgment.
                  Hence, we propose a model of how people evaluate others'
                  behavior: We argue that individuals principally judge the
                  righteousness of another person's behavior by assessing the
                  likelihood that they would act the same way if they were in
                  the person's shoes. That is, if you see another person steal,
                  you will consider the contexts where you too would steal and
                  assess the likelihood that any of these contexts are true,
                  given the available information. This idea can be formalized
                  as a Bayesian model that treats moral judgment as
                  probabilistic reasoning. We tested this model across four
                  studies (N = 601) involving either fictional moral vignettes
                  or economic games. The studies yielded converging evidence
                  showing that the proposed model better predicts moral judgment
                  under uncertainty than traditional theories that emphasize
                  social norms or perceived harm/utility. Overall, the present
                  studies support a new model of moral judgment with the
                  potential to unite research on social judgment,
                  decision-making, and probabilistic reasoning. Beyond this
                  specific model, the present studies also more generally speak
                  to how individuals parse uncertainty by integrating across
                  different possibilities.},

                  whether this effect can extend to nostalgia-unrelated

                  social support, which in turn encourages consumers to adopt
                  new products, and this effect is weakened when individuals
                  have independent self-construal. Three studies provide support
                  for these predictions. Study 1 revealed that nostalgia

                  of global online communities, humans and machines are
                  increasingly participating in mixed collectives in which they
                  can help or hinder each other. Human societies have had
                  thousands of years to consolidate the social norms that
                  promote cooperation; but mixed collectives often struggle to
                  articulate the norms which hold when humans coexist with
                  machines. In five studies involving 7917 individuals, we
                  document the way people treat machines differently than humans
                  in a stylized society of beneficiaries, helpers, punishers,
                  and trustors. We show that a different amount of trust is
                  gained by helpers and punishers when they follow norms over
                  not doing so. We also demonstrate that the trust-gain of
                  norm-followers is associated with trustors' assessment about
                  the consensual nature of cooperative norms over helping and
                  punishing. Lastly, we establish that, under certain
                  conditions, informing trustors about the norm-consensus over
                  helping tends to decrease the differential treatment of both
                  machines and people interacting with them. These results allow
                  us to anticipate how humans may develop cooperative norms for
                  human-machine collectives, specifically, by relying on already
                  extant norms in human-only groups. We also demonstrate that
                  this evolution may be accelerated by making people aware of
                  their emerging consensus.},

                  urge to buy a product or service in an online setting and it
                  has several negative consequences for customers, such as guilt
                  and financial distress, and e-commerce firms, such as higher
                  returns and customer complaints. Evidently, it is important to
                  examine the various psychological processes which may assist
                  in a better understanding, therefore addressing the high
                  prevalence of online impulse buying. This study builds upon
                  self-regulation theory to explore how mindfulness influences
                  online impulse buying, and examines problematic internet use
                  as a mediator in the relationship between mindfulness and
                  online impulse buying. Further, this study investigates how
                  emotional intelligence as a moderator plays the role of a
                  suppressant on the adverse impact of problematic Internet use
                  which fuels online impulse buying. Method: A total of 598
                  individuals working with various servicebased industries
                  responded to the questionnaire. Multiple regression and
                  moderated mediation analysis was used using SPSS and AMOS for
                  analyzing the data. Result: Problematic internet use mediates
                  the relationship between mindfulness and online impulse buying
                  behavior. Emotional intelligence negatively moderates the
                  relationship between problematic internet use and online
                  impulse buying behavior. Discussion: This study findings
                  outlined the inverse relationship of mindfulness \& online
                  impulse buying, along with the mediating effect of problematic
                  internet use between mindfulness and online impulse buying.
                  Further, this study showed how emotional intelligence played
                  an important role as a moderator by suppressing the adverse
                  impact of problematic Internet use and preventing online
                  impulse buying. The study offers implications to online

                  advertising, consumption, and product choice operates through
                  feelings of social connectedness, and thus research must

                  between uncertainty and interpersonal attraction. Two studies
                  investigated whether uncertainty regarding another person’s
                  interest is associated with an increase or decrease in
                  attraction. Study 1 revealed that when participants evaluated
                  people whose expressed attraction was either certain or
                  uncertain, participants experienced more liking for those who
                  were associated with certainty. In Study 2, compared to a
                  control condition, uncertainty produced more attraction but
                  the greater attraction was mediated by a desire to reduce
                  uncertainty. We conclude by proposing an explanation for why
                  different research paradigms have produced different
                  conclusions regarding uncertainty and the situations necessary
                  for uncertainty to produce interpersonal attraction.},

                  as a member of a particular group and that concerns events or

                  ethnocentric preference for ingroup (compared to outgroup)

                  experiences shared with other Greeks (compared to controls)
                  evinced a highly robust preference for Greek (compared to

                  domestic country bias. Following a systematic

                  idiographic and nomothetic inductions of collective nostalgia

                  collective nostalgia increased domestic country bias across
                  different product categories (Experiment 2), and that

                  nostalgia on domestic country bias and did so independently of

                  motivation, and greater life satisfaction and disadvantages,

                  conducted three studies (n = 593) to test our hypotheses. The
                  first study tested the correlation between trait mindfulness
                  and the purchase intentions of sensory ads. The results showed
                  that the level of trait mindfulness and purchase intentions

                  fostering a sense of food comfort (i.e., safety and security)
                  among potential consumers. Experiment 1, testing a Chinese

                  strengthen purchase intentions of food items when such items
                  are intrinsically nostalgic. Experiment 2 showed that

                  paradoxical finding that providing individuals with more
                  options can be detrimental to choice, the question of whether
                  and when large assortments impede choice remains open. Even
                  though extant research has identified a variety of antecedents
                  and consequences of choice overload, the findings of the
                  individual studies fail to come together into a cohesive
                  understanding of when large assortments can benefit choice and
                  when they can be detrimental to choice. In a meta‐analysis of
                  99 observations (N = 7202) reported by prior research, we
                  identify four key factors—choice set complexity, decision task
                  difficulty, preference uncertainty, and decision goal—that
                  moderate the impact of assortment size on choice overload. We
                  further show that each of these four factors has a reliable
                  and significant impact on choice overload, whereby higher
                  levels of decision task difficulty, greater choice set
                  complexity, higher preference uncertainty, and a more
                  prominent, effort‐minimizing goal facilitate choice overload.
                  We also find that four of the measures of choice overload used
                  in prior research—satisfaction/confidence, regret, choice
                  deferral, and switching likelihood—are equally powerful
                  measures of choice overload and can be used interchangeably.
                  Finally, we document that when moderating variables are taken
                  into account the overall effect of assortment size on choice
                  overload is significant—a finding counter to the data reported
                  by prior meta‐analytic research.},

                  method for eliciting willingness to pay (WTP) with an

                  contrast to the traditional approach of eliciting WTP as a

  abstract     = {This paper examines how the ability of traditional media firms
                  to engage in targeted advertising has changed with the advent
                  of the Internet. We find that the premium for reaching a
                  homogeneous audience increases for magazines that have a
                  companion website, as well as for those whose readers are more
                  likely to be online. This indicates a complementarity between
                  offline and online channels with respect to targeted
                  advertising. We hypothesize that this result is driven by
                  multihoming consumers who enhance the value of targeted
                  advertising, in contrast to the usual assumption that multiple
                  advertising messages are redundant. This paper was accepted by

  abstract     = {Recent studies have shown that avoidance behavior may become
                  excessive and inflexible (i.e., detached from its incentive
                  value and resistant to extinction). On the other hand,
                  prospective intolerance of uncertainty (P-IU) has been defined
                  as a factor leading to excessive responding in uncertain
                  situations. Thus, uncertain avoidance situations may be taken
                  as a relevant scenario to examine the role of intolerance of
                  uncertainty as a factor that facilitates excessive and
                  inflexible avoidance behavior. In our experiment, we tested
                  the hypothesis that P-IU is associated with excessive and
                  inflexible avoidance in an outcome devaluation paradigm.
                  Specifically, healthy participants learned in a free-operant
                  discriminative task to avoid an aversive sound, and were
                  tested in extinction to measure the sensitivity of avoidance
                  responses to the devaluation of the sound aversiveness. The
                  results showed that an increase in P-IU was positively
                  associated to an increase in insensitivity to the devaluation.
                  Moreover, P-IU was also related to an increase in the
                  frequency of avoidance responses during the instrumental
                  learning phase, and to resistance to extinction.
                  Interestingly, these associations involving P-IU were still
                  significant when trait anxiety was controlled for. The pattern
                  of results suggests that P-IU may be a vulnerability factor
                  for excessive and inflexible avoidance, which, in turn, has
                  been found to be associated with several mental disorders.},

  abstract     = {Stress and anxiety can both influence risk-taking in
                  decision-making. While stress typically increases risk-taking,
                  anxiety often leads to risk-averse choices. Few studies have
                  examined both stress and anxiety in a single paradigm to
                  assess risk-averse choices. We therefore set out to examine
                  emotional decision-making under stress in socially anxious
                  participants. In our study, individuals (N = 87) high or low
                  in social anxiety completed an expanded variation of the
                  Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART). While inflating a balloon
                  to a larger degree is rewarded, a possible explosion leads to
                  (a) a loss of money and (b) it is followed by an emotional
                  picture (i.e., a calm vs. an angry face). To induce stress
                  before this task, participants were told that they would have
                  to deliver a speech. We operationalized risk-taking by the
                  number of pumps during inflation and its functionality by the
                  amount of monetary gain. In addition, response times were
                  recorded as an index of decisional conflict. Without the
                  stressor, high socially anxious compared to low socially
                  anxious participants did not differ in any of the dependent
                  variables. However, under stress, the low socially anxious
                  group took more risk and earned more money, while high
                  socially anxious individuals remained more cautious and did
                  not change their risk-taking under social stress. Overall,
                  high socially anxious individuals made their decisions more
                  hesitantly compared to low socially anxious individuals.
                  Unexpectedly, there were no main effects or interactions with
                  the valence of the emotional faces. This data shows that
                  stress affects socially anxious individuals differently: in
                  low socially anxious individuals stress fosters risk-taking,
                  whereas high socially anxious individuals did not alter their
                  behavior and remained risk-averse. The novel eBART is a
                  promising research tool to examine the specific factors that
                  influence decision-making.},

                  seasoned reviewers, hoping to get feedback. While these
                  reviewers are given free samples to review, they also buy and
                  review products themselves. The regular ratings for the
                  purchased products are the majority. This brings up the
                  question: Does receiving free products make them rate their
                  personal purchases more positively? And if so, why? We
                  explored two possibilities. First, uncertainty reduction
                  mechanism: The idea that trying free samples makes buyers more
                  confident in their purchases, leading to greater satisfaction
                  and higher ratings for the purchased products; Second,
                  reciprocity mechanism: The idea that reviewers might feel
                  obliged to give better ratings as a “thank you” for the free
                  samples or with the expectations of getting more free samples,
                  which could introduce bias. Our research indicates that giving
                  free samples mainly helps in reducing purchase uncertainty,
                  making customers genuinely happier with their subsequent
                  purchases. So, online platforms can benefit from this
                  strategy, as it seems to uplift genuine positive reviews
                  rather than create biased ones. However, it is still essential

                  personalized needs of customers are increasing rapidly. It
                  often occurs that frontline employees bend organizational
                  rules to help customers. The study sought to explore the
                  influence mechanism of specific dimensions of
                  customer-oriented deviance on brand trust from the customer's
                  perspective, examine the mediating role of perceived benefits
                  and perceived uncertainty, and the moderating role of customer
                  involvement in the process. Methods: We conducted an online
                  survey study in China from May 1 to 20, 2022. We use online
                  survey questionnaire technique and random sampling method for
                  data collection. Participants anonymously completed the
                  measures of customer-oriented deviance scale, perceived
                  benefits scale, perceived uncertainty scale, brand trust
                  scale, and customer involvement scale. Results: The results
                  show that deviant service adaptation and deviant use of
                  resources positively affect brand trust through the mediation
                  of perceived benefits. In contrast, deviant service
                  communication has a negative effect on brand trust through the
                  mediation of perceived uncertainty. Furthermore, customer
                  involvement plays a negative moderating role in the
                  relationship between deviant service adaptation, deviant use
                  of resources, and perceived benefits. Customer involvement
                  plays a negative moderating role in the relationship between
                  deviant service communication and perceived uncertainty.
                  Conclusion: Current results demonstrated that there is a
                  double-edged sword effect of deviant customer-oriented
                  behaviors on brand trust. Deviant service adaptation and
                  deviant use of resources positively affect perceived benefits,
                  and perceived benefits positively affect brand trust. Deviant
                  service communication positively affects perceived
                  uncertainty, and perceived uncertainty negatively affects
                  brand trust. Customer involvement plays a negative moderating
                  role in the above processes. This study enriches the study of
                  customer psychological states of customer-oriented deviance,
                  which helps managers use organizational resources rationally
                  to guide and control different types of deviant
                  customer-oriented behaviors effectively. It provides

                  that reflects the true state of affairs and to develop a
                  conceptual model that examines the moderating effect of
                  uncertainty on relative brand trust–love.
                  Design/methodology/approach Extant empirical studies,
                  conceptual literature and related theories were identified and
                  integrated to develop the conceptual model. Findings Findings
                  of the study suggest that relative brand trust–love arises
                  because of different components of uncertainty. Relative brand
                  trust–love exhibited by the customer is moderated by
                  uncertainty at the individual level, brand level and
                  technology level. These uncertainties represent the situation
                  that considers if relative brand trust–love can be enhanced. A
                  few propositions have been suggested for such situations to
                  enhance relative brand trust–love. Research
                  limitations/implications This paper proposes a conceptual
                  model and also makes research propositions that need to be
                  validated and confirmed empirically. It adds value to
                  theoretical advancements in strengthening the customer–brand
                  relationship. Furthermore, results suggest that relative brand
                  trust–love can be improved over time if these components can
                  be supported by increasing information at different levels.
                  The conclusions will be informative to practitioners and brand
                  managers in strengthening a brand into the market more
                  effectively. Moreover, it can transform the brand into a
                  global brand and help build sustainable long-term
                  relationships. Findings can be useful and interesting
                  information for the researchers who are interested in finding
                  strategic ways for effective decision-making related to brand
                  trust and brand love. Originality/value The conceptual model,
                  and the propositions related to different levels of
                  uncertainty, and its effect on relative brand trust–love, is a

                  motivations underlying people’s decision to exit their groups
                  have been underexamined. Integrating uncertainty-identity
                  theory with literature on disidentification, we conducted
                  three studies ( NTotal = 891) to investigate how different
                  domains of uncertainty affect group identification and
                  disidentification, and how these identification processes
                  predict people’s exit intentions. In Studies 1a (religious
                  congregations) and 1b (organizations), we measured different
                  domains of uncertainty (self, social identity) before
                  measuring group identification, disidentification, and exit
                  intentions. Study 2 manipulated domains of uncertainty (self,
                  social identity) and levels of uncertainty (high, low) before
                  measuring the same outcome variables. Results showed stronger
                  social identity uncertainty elicited stronger
                  disidentification and weaker group identification. Results
                  also showed that disidentification mediated the relationship
                  between social identity uncertainty and exit intentions.
                  Self-uncertainty did not relate to people’s exit intentions.

                  challenges, while insect proteins offer a low‐impact

                  hinder widespread acceptance of insect‐based foods, despite a
                  growing market. Research on consumer attitudes and purchase
                  intentions towards insect‐based foods yields mixed results,
                  prompting a meta‐analysis to explore cultural influences and
                  contextual factors. This meta‐analysis investigates consumers’
                  willingness to try insect‐based food products. Analysis of 24
                  publications (97 studies, with 13,609 observations;
                  participant Mage = 34.6), supports the notion that consumers
                  around the world are not readily willing to adopt insect‐based
                  food products. Moderating this effect, at the country level,
                  high uncertainty avoidance negatively affects consumers’
                  intentions to try insect‐based products. Two follow‐up studies
                  replicate the findings of the meta‐analysis, incorporating an
                  individual‐level assessment of the moderating effect of
                  uncertainty avoidance, and testing the mediating effect of
                  food neophobia on consumers’ (un)willingness to adopt
                  insect‐based food products. A third study provides evidence as
                  how to buffer the negative reactions of consumers towards
                  insect‐based foods: after sensory evaluation of a

                  stated expectations. Theoretical contributions and practical
                  implications for marketing strategy and communication, to
                  overcome the negative perceptions related to insect‐based

                  central concept in information economics–based approaches to
                  brand effects and brand equity, on consumer choice and choice
                  set formation. We investigate the mechanisms through which
                  credibility effects materialize, namely, through perceived
                  quality, perceived risk, and information costs saved. The
                  credibility of a brand as a signal is defined as the
                  believability of the product position information contained in
                  a brand, which depends on consumer perceptions of the
                  willingness and ability of firms to deliver what they have
                  promised. The choice set is defined as the collection of
                  brands that have a nonzero probability of being chosen among
                  those actually available for choice in a given context.
                  Furthermore, we study the impact of brand credibility on the
                  variance of the stochastic component of utility. Not only do
                  choice model parameters capture the impact of systematic
                  utility differences on choice probabilities, but also the
                  magnitude of this systematic impact is moderated by the
                  relative importance of the stochastic utility component in
                  preference. We term this moderation phenomenon preference
                  discrimination, which we conceptualize as the decision makers'
                  capacity to effectively discriminate between products'
                  utilities in choice situations. We estimate a discrete choice
                  model of brand choice set formation and preference
                  discrimination on experimental data in two categories—juice
                  and personal computers—and find strong evidence for brand
                  credibility effects and differential mechanisms through which
                  brand credibility's impact materializes on brand choice
                  conditional on choice set, choice set formation, and
                  preference discrimination.},

                  with heightened anxiety, stress and approach-oriented coping.
                  Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is a trait characteristic that
                  arises from negative beliefs about uncertainty and its
                  consequences. Researchers have established the central role of
                  IU in the development of problematic worry and maladaptive
                  coping, highlighting the importance of this construct to
                  anxiety disorders. However, there is a need to improve our
                  understanding of the phenomenology of IU. The goal of this
                  paper was to present hypotheses regarding the similarities and
                  differences between IU and three related
                  constructs--intolerance of ambiguity, uncertainty orientation,
                  and need for cognitive closure--and to call for future
                  empirical studies to substantiate these hypotheses. To assist
                  with achieving this goal, we conducted a systematic review of
                  the literature, which also served to identify current gaps in
                  knowledge. This paper differentiates these constructs by
                  outlining each definition and general approaches to
                  assessment, reviewing the existing empirical relations, and
                  proposing theoretical similarities and distinctions. Findings

                  on a frontier market with high uncertainty avoidance still
                  needs to be shed light. Therefore, this study investigated the
                  relationship of country of origin image with consumer purchase
                  intention through consumer uncertainty. The study further
                  explored the conditional effect of brand image between country
                  of origin and consumer
                  uncertainty.Design/methodology/approachThe data for this study
                  was collected from 400 Pakistani consumers. As this study
                  assessed purchase intentions and consumer uncertainty related
                  to high technology products of China, therefore, the consumers
                  of the Huawei brand were selected.FindingsThe findings
                  revealed a negative influence of country of origin image on
                  consumer purchase intentions both directly and indirectly
                  through consumer uncertainty. Furthermore, the positive brand

                  Perceived risk has generally not been awarded a major role
                  while uncertainty, which is viewed here as distinct from risk,
                  has for the most part been disregarded. The study reported in

                  uncertainties associated with a new service, Internet Banking,
                  during the early stages of its market development. The
                  empirical research involved a qualitative study of a small
                  sample of consumers and a survey of both adopters and
                  non-adopters of Internet Banking. The survey employed a
                  traditional research instrument, which involved the
                  presentation of pre-identified risks and uncertainties. It was
                  possible to identify several major ‘risks’ as well as
                  ‘uncertainties’. We raise questions about whether or not the
                  anxieties and concerns identified by such a process of
                  consumer research are true reflections of the major influences

                  on the view that consumers may lack certainty about outcomes

                  large literature in marketing and related disciplines has
                  found a positive relationship between uncertainty and
                  information search: as consumers' uncertainty about a brand,
                  product, or service increases, so does their inclination to
                  seek out and engage with information. In contrast to this
                  conventional view, the present research proposes and
                  demonstrates a curvilinear (inverted-U) relationship between
                  uncertainty and information search. Conceptually, we put forth
                  theoretical insight for this relationship: uncertainty
                  increases both accuracy and efficiency considerations,
                  presenting an inherent tradeoff. This tradeoff is perceived to
                  be more favorable at moderate levels of uncertainty relative
                  to low and high levels. Empirically, we observe an inverted-U
                  relationship between uncertainty and information search across
                  three experiments and find evidence consistent with our

                  adaptive emotion regulation strategies and their association

                  In our models, both usage experience and advertising exposure
                  give consumers noisy signals about brand attributes. Consumers
                  use these signals to update their expectations of brand
                  attributes in a Bayesian manner. The two models are (1) a
                  dynamic model with immediate utility maximization, and (2) a
                  dynamic “forward-looking” model in which consumers maximize
                  the expected present value of utility over a planning horizon.
                  Given this theoretical framework, we derive from the Bayesian
                  learning framework how brand choice probabilities depend on
                  past usage experience and advertising exposures. We then form

                  exponential smoothing, and also perform better at
                  out-of-sample prediction. Another finding is that in the
                  context of consumer learning of product attributes, although
                  the forward-looking model fits the data statistically better
                  at conventional significance levels, both models produce
                  similar parameter estimates and policy implications. Our
                  estimates indicate that consumers are risk-averse with respect
                  to variation in brand attributes, which discourages them from
                  buying unfamiliar brands. Using the estimated behavioral
                  models, we perform various scenario evaluations to find how
                  changes in marketing strategy affect brand choice both in the
                  short and long run. A key finding obtained from the policy
                  experiments is that advertising intensity has only weak short
                  run effects, but a strong cumulative effect in the long run.
                  The substantive content of the paper is potentially of
                  interest to academics in marketing, economics and decision
                  sciences, as well as product managers, marketing research
                  managers and analysts interested in studying the effectiveness
                  of marketing mix strategies. Our paper will be of particular
                  interest to those interested in the long run effects of
                  advertising. Note that our estimation strategy requires us to
                  specify explicit behavioral models of consumer choice
                  behavior, derive the implied relationships among choice
                  probabilities, past purchases and marketing mix variables, and
                  then estimate the behavioral parameters of each model. Such an
                  estimation strategy is referred to as “structural” estimation,
                  and econometric models that are based explicitly on the
                  consumer's maximization problem and whose parameters are
                  parameters of the consumers' utility functions or of their
                  constraints are referred to as “structural” models. A key
                  benefit of the structural approach is its potential usefulness
                  for policy evaluation. The parameters of structural models are
                  invariant to policy, that is, they do not change due to a
                  change in the policy. In contrast, the parameters of reduced
                  form brand choice models are, in general, functions of
                  marketing strategy variables (e.g., consumer response to price
                  may depend on pricing policy). As a result, the predictions of
                  reduced form models for the outcomes of policy experiments may
                  be unreliable, because in making the prediction one must
                  assume that the model parameters are unaffected by the policy
                  change. Since the agents in our models choose among many
                  alternative brands, their choice probabilities take the form
                  of higher-order integrals. We employ Monte-Carlo methods to
                  approximate these integrals and estimate our models using
                  simulated maximum likelihood. Estimation of the dynamic
                  forward-looking model also requires that a dynamic programming
                  problem be solved in order to form the likelihood function.
                  For this we use a new approximation method based on simulation
                  and interpolation techniques. These estimation techniques may
                  be of interest to researchers and policy makers in many fields
                  where dynamic choice among discrete alternatives is important,
                  such as marketing, decision sciences, labor and health
                  economics, and industrial organization.},

  abstract     = {Purpose This study aims to examine the effects of the
                  advertising appeals (AP) on consumers’ behavioural intention,
                  specifically to use global brands. In addition, the study
                  investigates how attitude operates as a process variable that
                  mediates the relationship between AP and behavioural intention
                  (BI). This paper also explores the congruity of individuals’
                  norms in advertising appeal–intention relationship. Centred on
                  the theory of planned behaviour, this study proposes a model
                  that encompasses norm congruence, in which the degree of
                  individuals’ uncertainty avoidance (UA) moderates the
                  relationship between advertising appeal (AP) and behavioural
                  intention (BI), and attitude towards advertising appeal (AT)
                  serve as key causal mechanism that mediates advertising
                  appeal–behaviour relationship. Design/methodology/approach The
                  proposed model was tested using a 2 × 2 experimental design
                  with a sample size of 372. Findings Results showed that the
                  relationship between AP and BI based on global brands is
                  significantly mediated by attitude towards AP and moderated by
                  uncertainty avoidance. These findings have yielded partial
                  validation of the proposed model and have provided empirical
                  support for the roles of uncertainty avoidance and attitude
                  towards AP. Practical implications The authors propose that
                  marketers should reduce the level of consumers’ uncertainty.
                  Uncertainty avoidance effects can be achieved through the
                  dissemination of norm-congruent advertisement appeals and by
                  placing more weight on social compatibility attributes which
                  may gratify consumers’ interest, sebsequently enhance the
                  intention of Muslim consumers to use global brands.
                  Originality/value A moderator is a variable that affects the
                  strength of the relation between the predictor and criterion
                  variable. This paper also explores the congruity of
                  individuals’ norms in advertising appeal–intention
                  relationship. Previous studies did not capture any effects of
                  culturally congruent advertising appeals by considering the
                  level of uncertainty avoidance influence on individuals’
                  intention to use global brands in a Muslim country context. In
                  response to the recent calls for research to re-examine the
                  antecedents of the theory of planned behaviour, this study
                  re-evaluates the roles of attitude towards AP and the
                  interaction of cultural norms.},

                  experience. Though its assertion runs counter to most
                  prescriptions, the current research proposes that exposing
                  consumers to the mere possibility of negative experiences
                  occurring in a consumption sequence increases consumers’
                  happiness with those experiences over time. Six studies

                  hedonic responses as a result of favorable uncertainty
                  resolution. That is, with the mere possibility of a negative
                  experience, a consumer who actually experiences a positive
                  outcome is likely to feel relief or pleasure from not having

                  are chosen or purchased without knowing the exact nature of
                  the product(s). In contrast to the widely accepted notion of
                  uncertainty aversion, the present research shows that
                  consumers prefer uncertainty over certainty in the context of
                  mysterious consumption. Across a variety of products (stress
                  balls, ice cream, songs, teas, snacks, hotel rooms, masks,
                  rental cars), participants preferred mysterious consumption
                  items over non-mysterious consumption items of equal expected
                  value. The value of mysterious consumption lies at least in
                  part in the uncertainty about the nature of the outcome among
                  objectively similar outcomes. Specifically, the uncertainty
                  around horizontally differentiated outcomes (i.e., outcomes
                  that differ as a matter of taste) in the case of mysterious
                  consumption focuses consumers on the positive side of
                  uncertainty: the opportunity to be surprised. The preference
                  for uncertainty is not observed when the possible outcomes are
                  vertically differentiated (i.e., outcomes that differ in
                  objective superiority, as is the case in existing
                  demonstrations of uncertainty) or when horizontal uncertainty
                  is reduced to a degree that diminishes the ability to be
                  surprised. The findings reconcile literatures on surprise and
                  uncertainty aversion and help explain mysterious consumption
                  as a substantive phenomenon in the marketplace.},

                  repeat a behavior (e.g., a purchase) after receiving an

                  repetition? Four experiments, all involving real consequences
                  for each individual participant, document a counterintuitive
                  reinforcing-uncertainty effect: individuals repeat a behavior
                  more if its incentive is uncertain than if it is certain, even
                  when the certain incentive is financially better. This effect
                  is robust; it holds in both lab and field settings and at both
                  small and large magnitudes. Furthermore, the experiments
                  identify two theory-driven boundary conditions for the

                  two products by focusing more on alignable differences (i.e.,

                  different) than on nonalignable differences (i.e., the options
                  have different attributes). The present research applies the
                  structural alignment model to examine how uncertainty
                  associated with the evaluation of services may lead to greater
                  reliance on nonalignable attributes, especially for credence
                  services. The results of three studies provide support for the
                  uncertainty hypothesis. Specifically, study 1 showed that
                  consumers rely more on alignable attributes when evaluating
                  experience services, but shift their focus to nonalignable
                  attributes when evaluating credence services that are
                  associated with greater uncertainty. Using different
                  operationalizations of uncertainty, studies 2 and 3 provided
                  further support for the uncertainty hypothesis by
                  systematically varying the ambiguity of consumer reviews
                  (study 2) and consumer confidence in their judgment (study 3).},

  abstract     = {AbstractWhen a consumer realizes that information relevant to
                  a consumption decision is missing, such uncertainty can be
                  attributed to ignorance (i.e., the information has never been
                  observed and is unknown) or to memory failure (i.e., the
                  information has been observed and is forgotten). Although
                  research has examined inferences about unknown attributes, no
                  prior work has examined inferences about forgotten attributes.
                  Across six experiments in the lab and in the field, we find
                  that when uncertainty is attributed to ignorance, consumers
                  often make inferences about unknown attributes based on
                  existing correlational evidence (e.g., a brand comparison
                  sheet that could indicate a positive or negative correlation
                  between the unknown attribute and observable attributes).
                  However, when uncertainty is attributed to memory failure,
                  consumers tend to ignore such existing correlational evidence
                  and instead make inferences about forgotten attributes that
                  tend to be positively correlated with known attributes. This
                  process occurs partly because when consumers believe that an
                  attribute was forgotten, they falsely retrieve an impression
                  about the attribute that tends to be consistent with their
                  overall product evaluation. Overall, believing that an
                  attribute is forgotten and believing that it is unknown can
                  lead to opposite inferences and choices.},

                  underappreciated benefit of teasing in information
                  acquisition: first creating and then resolving an uncertainty
                  can generate a net positive experience, yet laypeople do not
                  seek out this process. For example, trivia readers report
                  better hedonic experiences if they are first teased with some
                  missing information and then given that information than if
                  they receive all the information at the same time; however,
                  when given a choice, readers prefer to receive all information
                  at the same time. The authors further show that teasing is
                  hedonically beneficial because uncertainty engenders curiosity
                  and thereby builds a potential for a positive experience,
                  whereas uncertainty resolution satisfies the curiosity and

                  choice, the authors show in cross-sectional and longitudinal
                  investigations (Study 1) that when adoption is in the distant
                  future, people are more concerned about performance- and
                  symbolic-benefit uncertainties. In contrast, in the near
                  future, the concerns are more about switching- and
                  affective-cost uncertainties. In Studies 2 and 2a, using
                  theories of mental simulation, the authors show that in the
                  distant-future adoption scenario, communication strategies
                  that promote outcome simulations are more effective in
                  reducing performance uncertainty, bolstering positive
                  feelings, and enhancing behavioral intentions. In contrast, in
                  the near-future adoption scenario, communication strategies
                  that promote process simulations are better at reducing
                  switching cost and affective uncertainties, assuaging anxiety,

                  positive effects of these communication strategies on actual
                  adoption rates and postconsumption satisfaction (Study 2) and
                  on delayed behavioral intentions (Study 2a). In addition,
                  these communication strategies are more efficacious in
                  increasing behavioral intentions when uncertainty levels are
                  higher (Study 3). The key managerial implications are that
                  communication strategies for new products need to reduce
                  uncertainties about costs and benefits and account for
                  temporal distance to adoption.},

                  has been posited that polarization arises because of an
                  inability to tolerate uncertainty and a need to hold
                  predictable beliefs about the world, evidence for this
                  hypothesis remains elusive. We examined the relationship
                  between uncertainty tolerance and political polarization using
                  a combination of brain-to-brain synchrony and intersubject
                  representational similarity analysis, which measured committed
                  liberals' and conservatives' (n = 44) subjective
                  interpretation of naturalistic political video material.
                  Shared ideology between participants increased neural
                  synchrony throughout the brain during a polarizing political
                  debate filled with provocative language but not during a
                  neutrally worded news clip on polarized topics or a
                  nonpolitical documentary. During the political debate, neural
                  synchrony in mentalizing and valuation networks was modulated
                  by one's aversion to uncertainty: Uncertainty-intolerant
                  individuals experienced greater brain-to-brain synchrony with
                  politically like-minded peers and lower synchrony with
                  political opponents-an effect observed for liberals and
                  conservatives alike. Moreover, the greater the neural
                  synchrony between committed partisans, the more likely that
                  two individuals formed similar, polarized attitudes about the
                  debate. These results suggest that uncertainty attitudes gate
                  the shared neural processing of political narratives, thereby
                  fueling polarized attitude formation about hot-button issues.},

                  its contribution to various psychopathologies, in particular

                  for Eating Disorders (EDs) however, potential factors
                  contributing to IU in EDs remain unstudied. METHODS: Three
                  hundred and forty-nine women with ED symptoms and 214
                  individuals without ED symptoms were recruited and compared on
                  levels of IU, insecure (anxious and avoidant) attachment
                  styles, extraversion and openness. Secondly, the contribution
                  of these factors to IU were tested. RESULTS: Compared to the
                  non-ED group, the ED group scored higher on IU, insecure
                  attachment, and lower on extraversion and openness. Regression
                  analyses confirmed that higher insecure attachment, and lower
                  extraversion predicted higher IU scores in the ED group, and
                  that insecure attachment predicted higher IU scores in the
                  non-ED group. CONCLUSIONS: Results confirm the relevance of IU
                  to ED, and demonstrate that personality traits and insecure
                  attachment styles contribute to IU in ED. Findings add to the

  abstract     = {Since its emergence in the early 1990s, a narrow but
                  concentrated body of research has developed examining the role
                  of intolerance of uncertainty (IU) in worry, and yet we still
                  know little about its phenomenology. In an attempt to clarify
                  our understanding of this construct, this paper traces the way
                  in which our understanding and definition of IU have evolved
                  throughout the literature. This paper also aims to further our
                  understanding of IU by exploring the latent variables measures
                  by the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS; Freeston,
                  Rheaume, Letarte, Dugas \& Ladouceur, 1994). A review of the
                  literature surrounding IU confirmed that the current
                  definitions are categorical and lack specificity. A critical
                  review of existing factor analytic studies was carried out in
                  order to determine the underlying factors measured by the IUS.
                  Systematic searches yielded 9 papers for review. Two factors
                  with 12 consistent items emerged throughout the exploratory
                  studies, and the stability of models containing these two
                  factors was demonstrated in subsequent confirmatory studies.
                  It is proposed that these factors represent (i) desire for
                  predictability and an active engagement in seeking certainty,
                  and (ii) paralysis of cognition and action in the face of
                  uncertainty. It is suggested that these factors may represent
                  approach and avoidance responses to uncertainty. Further
                  research is required to confirm the construct validity of
                  these factors and to determine the stability of this structure

  abstract  = {An introduction to decision making under uncertainty from a
               computational perspective, covering both theory and applications
               ranging from speech recognition to airborne collision avoidance.
               Many important problems involve decision making under
               uncertainty—that is, choosing actions based on often imperfect
               observations, with unknown outcomes. Designers of automated
               decision support systems must take into account the various
               sources of uncertainty while balancing the multiple objectives of
               the system. This book provides an introduction to the challenges
               of decision making under uncertainty from a computational
               perspective. It presents both the theory behind decision making
               models and algorithms and a collection of example applications
               that range from speech recognition to aircraft collision
               avoidance. Focusing on two methods for designing decision agents,
               planning and reinforcement learning, the book covers
               probabilistic models, introducing Bayesian networks as a
               graphical model that captures probabilistic relationships between
               variables; utility theory as a framework for understanding
               optimal decision making under uncertainty; Markov decision
               processes as a method for modeling sequential problems; model
               uncertainty; state uncertainty; and cooperative decision making
               involving multiple interacting agents. A series of applications
               shows how the theoretical concepts can be applied to systems for
               attribute-based person search, speech applications, collision
               avoidance, and unmanned aircraft persistent surveillance.
               Decision Making Under Uncertainty unifies research from different
               communities using consistent notation, and is accessible to
               students and researchers across engineering disciplines who have
               some prior exposure to probability theory and calculus. It can be
               used as a text for advanced undergraduate and graduate students
               in fields including computer science, aerospace and electrical
               engineering, and management science. It will also be a valuable
               professional reference for researchers in a variety of
               disciplines.},

                  objective indicators of historically unprecedented safety. A
                  perceived inability to tolerate uncertainty or distress
                  motivates individuals experiencing anxiety to engage in safety
                  behaviors. Mobile phones provide unrestricted access to safety
                  cues intended to reduce uncertainty and therein anxiety;
                  however, recurrent engagement in reassurance seeking behaviors
                  paradoxically increases anxiety. The current research was
                  designed to assess whether self-reported intolerance of
                  uncertainty (IU) levels may have been increasing and, if so,
                  whether the increases correlate positively with mobile phone
                  penetration and Internet usage. A cross-temporal meta-analysis
                  was conducted using data from 52 North American studies
                  exploring IU as well as social indicator data from several
                  public sources. A statistically significant increase in IU
                  levels occurred from 1999 to 2014, correlated with increases
                  in mobile phone penetration and Internet usage. As
                  hypothesized, IU levels appeared to be increasing over time
                  and the increases correlate positively with mobile phone
                  penetration and Internet usage. The results support the
                  possibility that mobile phones increase reassurance seeking,
                  acting as safety cues, and reducing spontaneous, everyday
                  exposures to uncertainty, which may ultimately potentiate
                  psychopathology by increasing IU and anxiety. Subsequent
                  experimental research to assess for causality appears
                  warranted. Limitations and directions for future research are

                  not widely examined – construct with clinical and nonclinical
                  associations. The current study implemented a brief reflection
                  on uncertainty hypothesized to increase tolerance of
                  uncertainty. The group who engaged in the reflection ( n = 50)
                  was compared to an active control condition ( n = 50). Results
                  demonstrated the opposite of the primary hypothesis: simply
                  reflecting on uncertainty significantly increased intolerance
                  of uncertainty (vs. tolerance of uncertainty). Results also
                  demonstrated that those higher in mindfulness were higher in
                  tolerance of uncertainty, with the “nonreactivity” factor of
                  mindfulness contributing unique variance. These findings
                  suggest multiple factors that might contribute to both

                  their mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Excessive
                  reactivity to uncertainty plays a central role in anxiety, and
                  may represent a mechanism for the effect of mindfulness on
                  anxiety, as mindfulness training fosters an open and accepting
                  stance towards all aspects of experience. The present study
                  sought to investigate both (i) self-reported intolerance of
                  uncertainty (IU) as well as (ii) physiological and subjective
                  responding to uncertain threat in a threat-of-shock paradigm,
                  the NPU-threat test, as mediators for the relationship between
                  mindfulness and anxiety in a cross-sectional study of healthy
                  participants (N = 53). The results indicated that IU mediated
                  the effect of mindfulness on some anxiety symptoms. In

                  largely unrelated to mindfulness, anxiety, or the IU

                  reactions to uncertainty may play a role in the
                  mindfulness-anxiety relationship and suggest that studies are
                  needed to address how methodological variations of the

                  associated with negative affect, but in some circumstances, it
                  is associated with positive affect. In this article, we review
                  different explanations for the varying relationship between
                  uncertainty and affect. We identify "mental simulation" as a
                  key process that links uncertainty to affective states. We
                  suggest that people have a propensity to simulate negative
                  outcomes, which result in a propensity toward negative
                  affective responses to uncertainty. We also propose the
                  existence of several important moderators of this process,
                  including context and individual differences such as
                  uncertainty tolerance, as well as emotion regulation

                  relationship between outcome uncertainty and attendance,

                  to games involving lower-quality teams in the National
                  Basketball Association (NBA). Based on our analyses, we have
                  discovered a notable distinction in the relationship between
                  outcome uncertainty and attendance in high-quality games. When
                  analyzing high-quality games, we observed a linear
                  relationship between these two variables that was only
                  marginally significant. Conversely, when exploring
                  nonhigh-quality games, a U-shaped relationship emerged between
                  outcome uncertainty and attendance. While the attendance of
                  nonhigh-quality games was influenced by varying levels of
                  uncertainty, high-quality games attracted fans irrespective of
                  the outcome uncertainty. This research provides valuable
                  insights into the factors that contribute to the popularity

  abstract     = {Humans update their social behavior in response to past
                  experiences and changing environments. Behavioral decisions
                  are further complicated by uncertainty in the outcome of
                  social interactions. Faced with uncertainty, some individuals
                  exhibit risk aversion while others seek risk. Attitudes toward
                  risk may depend on socioeconomic status; and individuals may
                  update their risk preferences over time, which will feedback
                  on their social behavior. Here, we study how uncertainty and
                  risk preferences shape the evolution of social behaviors. We
                  extend the game-theoretic framework for behavioral evolution
                  to incorporate uncertainty about payoffs and variation in how
                  individuals respond to this uncertainty. We find that
                  different attitudes toward risk can substantially alter
                  behavior and long-term outcomes, as individuals seek to
                  optimize their rewards from social interactions. In a standard
                  setting without risk, for example, defection always overtakes
                  a well-mixed population engaged in the classic Prisoner's
                  Dilemma, whereas risk aversion can reverse the direction of
                  evolution, promoting cooperation over defection. When
                  individuals update their risk preferences along with their
                  strategic behaviors, a population can oscillate between
                  periods dominated by risk-averse cooperators and periods of
                  risk-seeking defectors. Our analysis provides a systematic
                  account of how risk preferences modulate, and even coevolve
                  with, behavior in an uncertain social world.},

                  social life. Past research suggests uncertainty has a negative
                  effect on prosocial behaviour1-12 by enabling people to adopt
                  self-serving narratives about their actions1,13. We show that
                  uncertainty does not always promote selfishness. We introduce
                  a distinction between two types of uncertainty that have
                  opposite effects on prosocial behaviour. Previous work focused
                  on outcome uncertainty (uncertainty about whether or not a
                  decision will lead to a particular outcome). However, as soon
                  as people's decisions might have negative consequences for
                  others, there is also impact uncertainty (uncertainty about
                  how others' well-being will be impacted by the negative
                  outcome). Consistent with past research1-12, we found
                  decreased prosocial behaviour under outcome uncertainty. In
                  contrast, prosocial behaviour was increased under impact
                  uncertainty in incentivized economic decisions and
                  hypothetical decisions about infectious disease threats.
                  Perceptions of social norms paralleled the behavioural
                  effects. The effect of impact uncertainty on prosocial
                  behaviour did not depend on the individuation of others or the
                  mere mention of harm, and was stronger when impact uncertainty
                  was made more salient. Our findings offer insights into
                  communicating uncertainty, especially in contexts where
                  prosocial behaviour is paramount, such as responding to
                  infectious disease threats.},

                  factor in the social influence process. We argue that there
                  are two senses in which uncertainty plays a role. First, task
                  uncertainty is a necessary but variable condition for social
                  influence to occur. Second, uncertainty reduction is a
                  mechanism producing social influence. We discuss how tasks can
                  vary in the level of uncertainty they entail and how this
                  impacts the mechanisms resulting in social influence. In this
                  context, we predict that task uncertainty moderates social
                  influence and that uncertainty reduction mediates it. We
                  experimentally test our predictions in the
                  status-to-social-influence process using standard means of
                  studying social influence. Inconsistent with prior work, we do
                  not find that task uncertainty is a moderator, but we do find
                  evidence that uncertainty reduction functions as a mediator.
                  Further, we find that the mediated effect is contingent on

  abstract     = {Most theories describe motivation using basic terminology
                  (drive, 'wanting', goal, pleasure, etc.) that fails to inform
                  well about the psychological mechanisms controlling its
                  expression. This leads to a conception of motivation as a mere
                  psychological state 'emerging' from neurophysiological
                  substrates. However, the involvement of motivation in a large
                  number of behavioural parameters (triggering, intensity,
                  duration, and directedness) and cognitive abilities (learning,
                  memory, decision, etc.) suggest that it should be viewed as an
                  information processing system. The uncertainty processing
                  theory (UPT) presented here suggests that motivation is the
                  set of cognitive processes allowing organisms to extract
                  information from the environment by reducing uncertainty about
                  the occurrence of psychologically significant events. This
                  processing of information is shown to naturally result in the
                  highlighting of specific stimuli. The UPT attempts to solve
                  three major problems: (i) how motivations can affect behaviour
                  and cognition so widely, (ii) how motivational specificity for
                  objects and events can result from nonspecific
                  neuropharmacological causal factors (such as mesolimbic
                  dopamine), and (iii) how motivational interactions can be
                  conceived in psychological terms, irrespective of their
                  biological correlates. The UPT is in keeping with the
                  conceptual tradition of the incentive salience hypothesis
                  while trying to overcome the shortcomings inherent to this
                  view.},

                  the difference between fear and anxiety by pointing to the
                  special role played in anxiety by the need for epistemic
                  control and uncertainty reduction. We examine some typical
                  “questions” of anxiety, and some typical “answers” or coping
                  strategies, with special reference to their relationships with
                  either need for control. We focus on the need for epistemic
                  control, its relationship with pragmatic control, its impact

                  been the claim that fans desire balanced competition—the
                  so-called Uncertainty of Outcome Hypothesis (UOH). While this
                  idea has intuitive appeal, it runs counter to the equally
                  obvious importance of partisanship in shaping fan interest in
                  sporting contests. The absence of a well-accepted theoretical
                  basis for the UOH, coupled with a lack of compelling empirical
                  evidence in support of it, suggests important gaps in the
                  literature. This paper takes a step toward addressing the
                  former need by offering a contest utility function, based on
                  standard Cobb-Douglas preferences, which embodies both
                  partisanship and a demand for competitive balance. The model

                  of options. Experiments 3 and 4 test predictions drawn from
                  the literature on behavioral ecology. It is suggested that
                  choices between two options should reflect three parameters:
                  (1) the need of the organism, (2) the mean expected outcome of
                  each option; and (3) the variance associated with each
                  option's outcome. It is hypothesized that unknown
                  probabilities are avoided because they co-occur with high
                  outcome variability. In Experiment 3 it was found that
                  subjects systematically avoid options with high outcome
                  variability regardless of whether probabilities are explicitly
                  stated or not. In Experiment 4, we reversed the ambiguity
                  effect: when participants' need was greater than the known
                  option's expected mean outcome, subjects preferred the
                  ambiguous (high variance) option. From these experiments we
                  conclude that people do not generally avoid ambiguous options.
                  Instead, they take into account expected outcome, outcome
                  variability, and their need in order to arrive at a decision
                  that is most likely to satisfy this need.},

                  members (N = 1046; Mean age = 36.69 ± 12.31 years; 61\%
                  females) completed the Intolerance of Uncertainty Inventory
                  with the Beck Depression Inventory-II and the State-Trait

                  manifestations of Intolerance of Uncertainty for specific
                  disorders, provided that hierarchical scores are used.
                  Overall, our study suggest that clinical assessments might

                  enhancing entrepreneurial mindset. However, the role of
                  entrepreneurial mindset has not been examined in relation to
                  career adaptability, which has been acknowledged as an

                  increased uncertainty caused by COVID-19. The current study
                  investigated the relations among intolerance of
                  uncertainty—specifically its sub-factors, prospective anxiety
                  and inhibitory anxiety—career adaptability, and
                  entrepreneurial mindset in 274 Korean college students facing
                  school-to-work transition during COVID-19. The study conducted
                  path analysis and evaluated the mediating effect of
                  entrepreneurial mindset, using a 95\% bootstrapping confidence
                  interval, to better understand the role of entrepreneurial
                  mindset in general career development in the context of
                  uncertainty. The results found that inhibitory anxiety had an
                  inverse association with career adaptability and
                  entrepreneurial mindset, while prospective anxiety had a
                  positive relation with career adaptability and entrepreneurial
                  mindset. Entrepreneurial mindset and career adaptability
                  showed a significantly positive relation, and the mediating
                  role of entrepreneurial mindset between intolerance of
                  uncertainty and career adaptability was also supported.

                  individuals. Participants read context sentences predicting
                  threat or nonthreat outcomes. They subsequently named target
                  words that were consistent with or unrelated to prediction. In
                  Experiment 1, with predictability relatively low, anxious
                  participants showed clear threat bias in their inferences:
                  Although nonthreat targets were unaffected by context, shorter
                  naming latencies were found for threat target words that
                  followed a threat predicting context. A low anxiety group
                  showed an opposite effect, that is, facilitation only for
                  nonthreat words, suggesting an avoidance (of threat) bias. In
                  Experiment 2, under higher predictability, this bias
                  disappeared, as both high and low anxious groups performed
                  similarly. The relevance of these data for different models of
                  selective processing in anxiety is discussed. Of particular
                  pertinence is the finding that, with increasing stimulus
                  threat, low anxious participants no longer show avoidance;
                  instead, they infer threat in a way similar to the high
                  anxious. This suggests that the difference between the high
                  and the low anxious persons resides in the threshold at which
                  stimulus threat input is processed.},

               diagnosis is necessary to treat a patient, definition is
               necessary to theorise and manage a concept. It is not quite
               possible to manage risks without making a precise distinction
               between the concepts of uncertainty and risk. The change in the
               concepts of uncertainty and risk in the last three centuries has
               also steered the development of decision-making theories. The
               decision-making process is influenced by emotions, intuitions,
               personality and experiences. Examining this process under risk

                  Knight's Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit has significantly
                  influenced entrepreneurship theory development by exploring
                  the nature of uncertainty and the epistemic limits of
                  entrepreneurial action. Knight's work highlights how economic
                  actors cannot fully predict the consequences of their actions.
                  Despite its broad influence, debates persist regarding the
                  nature of Knightian uncertainty. This study addresses these
                  debates through a comprehensive analysis of RUP and Knight's
                  other published and unpublished writings to offer new insights
                  into the nature and meaning of Knightian uncertainty,
                  revealing Knight's holistic theory that integrates “real
                  indeterminism,” “partial knowledge,” and “subjective beliefs.”
                  This analysis provides much needed construct clarity to
                  advance contemporary theories of entrepreneurial action and
                  the role of uncertainty in business venturing
                  processes.Managerial SummaryThis article revisits Frank
                  Knight's foundational work, Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit, a
                  cornerstone in entrepreneurship research for over a century.
                  We highlight Knight's holistic approach to uncertainty, which
                  integrates the concepts of real indeterminism (the inherent
                  unpredictability of future events), partial knowledge (the
                  incomplete understanding of the present and future), and
                  subjective beliefs (individual perceptions and
                  interpretations). The study offers new perspectives on how
                  Knightian uncertainty influences entrepreneurial
                  decision‐making and action, highlighting how this unique type
                  of uncertainty plays a critical role in the business venturing
                  process. These insights provide valuable contributions to
                  contemporary theories of entrepreneurship, emphasizing the
                  complexity and multifaceted nature of navigating uncertainty

                  integrating cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) findings
                  regarding the importance of intolerance of uncertainty (IU)
                  and tendency to worry with findings regarding the importance
                  of trust in institutions, other people, and social support. We
                  assumed that trust in institutions, other people, and social
                  support reduce fear of the coronavirus and of the consequences
                  of the pandemic in a direct way, but also indirectly by
                  enhancing one's sense of control and diminishing the tendency
                  to worry which, further, attenuates fear of the coronavirus
                  and fear of the consequences of the pandemic. An online survey
                  was conducted among the Serbian general population (N = 1409,
                  78.1\% female, M = 38.82, SD = 9.24) at the end of April 2020,
                  which included questionnaires on fear of SARS-CoV-2, fear of
                  consequences of the pandemic, social support, trust in other
                  people and trust in political and health institutions. The
                  model has been validated by data from our study suggesting
                  that it represents one possible pattern of interrelationships
                  between social and intrapsychic variables in the pandemic
                  situation. Results also showed that the COVID-19 related fears
                  are related more strongly to intrapsychic variables - IU and
                  tendency to worry - than to variables operationalizing social
                  context relevant for coping with pandemic at the social and
                  individual level.},

                  relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and problem
                  orientation in nonclinical worry. Subjects were 285
                  French-Canadian university students who completed a battery of
                  questionnaires on a voluntary basis. The results indicate that
                  intolerance of uncertainty and emotional problem orientation
                  are strong predictors of trait worry, even when personal
                  variables (age, sex) and mood state (level of anxiety,
                  depression) have been partialed out. The findings also show
                  that intolerance of uncertainty and emotional problem
                  orientation both make common as well as a unique contributions
                  to the prediction of worry. Implications for the treatment of

                  tourism due to the economic-stagnant effects. Utilizing the
                  framework of the theory of reasoned action to analyze a global
                  sample of 124 countries over the period 1996–2017, we find
                  some initial evidence showing that an increase in economic
                  uncertainty encourages domestic tourism while reducing
                  outbound tourism in the global sample. Notably, while these
                  effects are consistent in the upper-middle-income economies,
                  an increase in uncertainty has a positive impact on both
                  domestic and outbound tourism in lower-middle-income economies
                  and a negative impact on both domestic and outbound tourism in
                  higher-income economies. The key implementation of this study

                  economic development and stability; sometimes it could be a

                  The number of cases and deaths caused by the pandemic directly
                  affects travel decisions. Answering how the public perception
                  of the pandemics affects visitor behaviour can provide

                  Accordingly, in the short run, global pandemic uncertainty

                  reduce tourist arrivals in Africa in comparison to other
                  global regions, such as Europe. Further disaggregation by
                  African regions reveals that economic uncertainties in West

                  moral, cognitive, and interpersonal self-uncertainty, and
                  different types of self-uncertainty were manipulated through
                  four experiments, including a moral dilemma, a recall

                  tendency to engage in conspicuous consumption. Our results
                  also suggest that tolerance of uncertainty moderates the

                  dramatically in recent years. Similarly, global and local
                  brands are facing many challenges in emerging markets. Thus,
                  in this backdrop, this research is intended to examine the
                  impact of consumer perceptions of brand localness and
                  globalness on brand attitude in order to predict consumer
                  behavioral intentions (purchase intention, price premium, and
                  word of mouth) in cross-cultural emerging markets (China and
                  Pakistan). Additionally, this research considered the
                  moderating effects of consumer ethnocentrism and brand
                  familiarity as a control variable. This study used an online
                  survey to examine 1,562 responses from Chinese (n = 768) and
                  Pakistani (n = 794) consumers regarding local and global
                  brands. The proposed hypotheses were analyzed by using the
                  partial least square-structural equation modeling method. The
                  findings indicated that the consumer perceptions of brand
                  localness and brand globalness had a substantial impact on
                  brand attitude, which in turn favorably influenced consumer
                  behavioral intentions in China and Pakistan. The brand
                  attitude was a crucial mediator in both markets but was more
                  critical in China than Pakistan. The interaction moderating
                  effects of consumer ethnocentrism and consumer perceptions of
                  brand localness positively influenced brand attitude in China,
                  whereas consumer ethnocentrism and consumer perceptions of
                  brand globalness negatively influenced brand attitude in
                  Pakistan. Interestingly, brand familiarity was discovered a
                  substantial control variable in both markets, except for
                  purchase intention in Pakistan. This research contributed to

  abstract     = {Abstract We examine how people (as observers) anticipate
                  levels of happiness from psychological consumption experiences
                  (e.g., learning a new language or visiting a park). All else
                  being equal, we propose and demonstrate that people expect
                  differences in happiness based on income. Specifically, we
                  show that relative to observers themselves, individuals
                  simultaneously expect low-income consumers to enjoy
                  psychological consumption experiences less and high-income
                  consumers to enjoy them more. This is because consumers hold a
                  lay theory that human needs must be fulfilled in a sequential,
                  linear manner, which leads to income-based inferences of need
                  prioritization. Thus, observers simultaneously believe that
                  low-income consumers do (and should) prioritize their
                  low-level physical needs first, but high-income consumers (who
                  have presumably already fulfilled their physical needs) can
                  prioritize their high-level psychological needs. Critically,
                  we demonstrate that these lay theory-driven inferences are
                  faulty, showing that the priority level assigned to these
                  needs and the actual happiness resulting from psychological
                  consumption experiences do not follow the predicted pattern.
                  Namely, income either has no relationship with actual
                  happiness (visitors to theme parks, sporting events, and
                  concerts), or the reverse relationship, such that lower-income
                  consumers report greater happiness than higher-income
                  consumers (secondary data from a major league professional
                  sports team).},

                  a surge of interest in interpretable machine learning: systems
                  that provide explanation for their outputs. These explanations
                  are often used to qualitatively assess other criteria such as
                  safety or non-discrimination. However, despite the interest in
                  interpretability, there is very little consensus on what
                  interpretable machine learning is and how it should be
                  measured. In this position paper, we first define
                  interpretability and describe when interpretability is needed
                  (and when it is not). Next, we suggest a taxonomy for rigorous
                  evaluation and expose open questions towards a more rigorous

                  theory, describes the amount of uncertainty and disorder
                  within a system. Self-organizing systems engage in a continual
                  dialogue with the environment and must adapt themselves to
                  changing circumstances to keep internal entropy at a
                  manageable level. We propose the entropy model of uncertainty
                  (EMU), an integrative theoretical framework that applies the
                  idea of entropy to the human information system to understand
                  uncertainty-related anxiety. Four major tenets of EMU are
                  proposed: (a) Uncertainty poses a critical adaptive challenge
                  for any organism, so individuals are motivated to keep it at a
                  manageable level; (b) uncertainty emerges as a function of the
                  conflict between competing perceptual and behavioral
                  affordances; (c) adopting clear goals and belief structures
                  helps to constrain the experience of uncertainty by reducing
                  the spread of competing affordances; and (d) uncertainty is
                  experienced subjectively as anxiety and is associated with
                  activity in the anterior cingulate cortex and with heightened
                  noradrenaline release. By placing the discussion of
                  uncertainty management, a fundamental biological necessity,
                  within the framework of information theory and self-organizing
                  systems, our model helps to situate key psychological
                  processes within a broader physical, conceptual, and

                  occurs. People invest more effort, time, and money to qualify
                  for an uncertain reward (e.g., a 50\% chance at $2 and a 50\%
                  chance at $1) than a certain reward of a higher expected value
                  (e.g., a 100\% chance at \$2). This effect arises only when
                  people focus on the process of pursuing a reward, not when
                  they focus on the outcome (the reward itself). When the focus
                  is on the process of reward pursuit, uncertainty generates
                  positive experience such as excitement and hence increases

                  studies, involving a total of 438 male and 336 female
                  undergraduates, assessed the scale's psychometric properties
                  and its relationships with several other instruments. The
                  scale was then used in a longitudinal study of symptom
                  reporting among 79 male and 62 female undergraduates. Ss were
                  asked to complete 3 questionnaires 4 wks before the end of a
                  semester. Included in the questionnaire battery were the
                  measure of optimism, a measure of private self-consciousness,
                  and a 39-item physical symptom checklist. Ss completed the
                  same set of questionnaires again on the last day of class.
                  Consistent with predictions, Ss who initially reported being
                  highly optimistic were subsequently less likely to report
                  being bothered by symptoms (even after correcting for initial
                  symptom-report levels) than were Ss who initially reported
                  being less optimistic. This effect tended to be stronger among
                  Ss high in private self-consciousness than among those lower
                  in private self-consciousness. Discussion centers on other
                  health related applications of the optimism scale and the
                  relationships between the theoretical orientation of the scale
                  and several related theories. (3 p ref) (PsycINFO Database

                  underlying mechanisms in relation to health is limited.
                  Therefore, this review sought to identify what the scientific
                  literature says about the influence of optimism and hope on
                  chronic disease treatment. A search was conducted in the
                  PsycINFO, Scopus, Pubmed, and Web of Science databases using
                  the indexing terms optimism, hope, chronic diseases,

                  characteristics investigated, the results found, and the

                  behaviors, regardless of their clinical status, and that this
                  contributes to chronic disease treatment. More research is

                  people to behave differently depending on their childhood

                  from poor childhoods to become more impulsive while leading
                  people from wealthy childhoods to become less impulsive.
                  Drawing on life history theory, we examine the psychological
                  mechanism driving such diverging responses to uncertainty.
                  Five experiments show that uncertainty alters people's sense
                  of control over the environment. Exposure to uncertainty led
                  people from poorer childhoods to have a significantly lower
                  sense of control than those from wealthier childhoods. In
                  addition, perceptions of control statistically mediated the
                  effect of uncertainty on impulsive behavior. These studies
                  contribute by demonstrating that sense of control is a
                  psychological driver of behaviors associated with fast and
                  slow life history strategies. We discuss the implications of
                  this for theory and future research, including that
                  environmental uncertainty might lead people who grew up poor
                  to quit challenging tasks sooner than people who grew up

                  information technologies, consumers’ individual information

                  previous purchase histories or browsing behaviors. Then the
                  targeted advertising can be directly sent to the heterogeneous
                  consumers in the segmented market by the firms. This study
                  aims to explore the possible role of targeting precision on
                  the market structure. This assay set up a game-theoretical
                  model with duopolistic firms. Both firms compete in prices and
                  imperfect targeted advertising. In this setup, the targeting
                  precision is variable. The results indicate that each
                  competitive firm’s equilibrium profit varies with the
                  targeting accuracy of targeted advertising and shows a U-shape
                  variation with precision. Moreover, both firms’ profits reveal
                  monotonic properties, improving targeting precision while
                  using distinct advertising strategies. Then, the model is
                  extended into n different competitive firms to seek the
                  possible market capacity. The results prove that the
                  equilibrium free-entry numbers of firms also exhibit a U-shape
                  variation as a function of targeting precision while sending
                  the imperfect targeted advertising to the consumers. This
                  conclusion implies that the firm conducting imperfect targeted
                  advertising with a moderate targeting precision is beneficial
                  for the most efficient free-entry of new rival competitive

                  empirical marketing research. However, investigations of how
                  big data helps inform consumers’ psychological aspects have,
                  thus far, only received scant attention. Psychographics has
                  been shown to be a valuable market segmentation path in
                  understanding consumer preferences. Although in the context of
                  e-commerce, as a component of psychographic segmentation,
                  personality has been proven to be effective for prediction of
                  e-commerce user preferences, it still remains unclear whether
                  psychographic segmentation is practically influential in
                  understanding user preferences across different product
                  categories. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first
                  quantitative demonstration of the promising effect and
                  relative importance of psychographic segmentation in
                  predicting users’ online purchasing preferences across
                  different product categories in e-commerce by using a
                  data-driven approach. We first construct two online
                  psychographic lexicons that include the Big Five Factor (BFF)
                  personality traits and Schwartz Value Survey (SVS) using
                  natural language processing (NLP) methods that are based on
                  behavior measurements of users’ word use. We then incorporate
                  the lexicons in a deep neural network (DNN)-based recommender
                  system to predict users’ online purchasing preferences
                  considering the new progress in segmentation-based user
                  preference prediction methods. Overall, segmenting consumers
                  into heterogeneous groups surprisingly does not demonstrate a
                  significant improvement in understanding consumer preferences.
                  Psychographic variables (both BFF and SVS) significantly
                  improve the explanatory power of e-consumer preferences,
                  whereas the improvement in prediction power is not
                  significant. The SVS tends to outperform BFF segmentation,
                  except for some product categories. Additionally, the DNN
                  significantly outperforms previous methods. An
                  e-commerce-oriented SVS measurement and segmentation approach
                  that integrates both BFF and the SVS is recommended. The
                  strong empirical evidence provides both practical guidance for
                  e-commerce product development, marketing and recommendations,
                  and a methodological reference for big data-driven marketing

                  experimental settings, people experienced a positive event

                  (knowable) uncertainty from aleatory (random) uncertainty and
                  show that the relative salience of these dimensions is
                  reflected in natural language use. We hypothesize that
                  confidence statements (e.g., “I am fairly confident,” “I am
                  90\% sure,” “I am reasonably certain”) communicate a
                  subjective assessment of primarily epistemic uncertainty,
                  whereas likelihood statements (e.g., “I believe it is fairly
                  likely,” “I’d say there is a 90\% chance,” “I think there is a
                  high probability”) communicate a subjective assessment of
                  primarily aleatory uncertainty. First, we show that speakers
                  tend to use confidence statements to express epistemic
                  uncertainty and they tend to use likelihood statements to
                  express aleatory uncertainty; we observe this in a 2-year
                  sample of New York Times articles (Study 1), and in
                  participants’ explicit choices of which statements more
                  naturally express different uncertain events (Studies 2A and
                  2B). Second, we show that when speakers apply confidence
                  versus likelihood statements to the same events, listeners
                  infer different reasoning (Study 3): confidence statements
                  suggest epistemic rationale (singular reasoning, feeling of
                  knowing, internal control), whereas likelihood statements
                  suggest aleatory rationale (distributional reasoning, relative
                  frequency information, external control). Third, we show that
                  confidence versus likelihood statements can differentially
                  prompt epistemic versus aleatory thoughts, respectively, as
                  observed when participants complete sentences that begin with

                  weak, especially with regard to initial interaction processes.
                  It is suggested that uncertainty reduction is not the primary
                  concern of individuals during this entry phase, as previously
                  posited. Rather, uncertainty reduction is cast as subordinate
                  to the more central concern of increasing positive relational
                  outcomes. During initial interactions, uncertainty reduction
                  is expected to enhance individuals perceived ability to
                  forecast future relational outcomes. Important initial
                  interaction behaviors and decisions are presumed to follow
                  from the values these forecasted outcomes take. Several major

                  in the late 1960s and early 1970s, dominates quantitative
                  culture research in international strategic management.
                  However, as countries develop economically, modernization
                  theory predicts shifts in cultural values, which likely affect
                  countries' scores on Hofstede's work-related values
                  dimensions, in turn raising doubt about the continued
                  relevance of this framework for global strategy researchers
                  and practitioners. We examine how country scores on Hofstede's
                  dimensions have developed over time by replicating Hofstede's
                  dimensions for two birth cohorts using data from the World
                  Values Survey. Results indicate that, on average, contemporary
                  societies score higher on Individualism and Indulgence versus
                  Restraint, and they score lower on Power Distance than do past
                  societies. We find that cultural change is absolute rather
                  than relative, meaning that countries' scores on the Hofstede
                  dimensions relative to the scores of other countries have not
                  changed very much. As a consequence, cultural differences
                  between country pairs (i.e., cultural distances) are generally
                  stable. We discuss the implications of our findings for global

                  test models for integrating the concept of motivation to
                  reduce uncertainty into the axiomatic structure of uncertainty
                  reduction theory. Multiple models were considered, each model
                  defining motivation to reduce uncertainty in a different way.
                  Motivation to reduce uncertainty was defined as a scope
                  condition (Model 2), as tolerance for uncertainty (Model 3),
                  as a weighted function of uncertainty by its importance (Model
                  4), and as the difference between one's uncertainty level and
                  one's tolerance for uncertainty (Models 5a and 5b). Each of
                  these models was compared to the baseline model (Model 1)
                  derived from the original presentation of the theory where
                  level of uncertainty, by itself, serves as a determinant of
                  various communication behaviors. Tests of these models in
                  terms of their ability to predict information seeking and
                  attraction reveal that none of the models provides a
                  consistent integration of motivation to reduce uncertainty
                  into uncertainty reduction theory. Rather, tolerance for
                  uncertainty (Model 3) is one of three determinants of
                  information seeking, while level of uncertainty (Model 1) is
                  one of three determinants of attraction. This inability to
                  integrate motivation to reduce uncertainty into uncertainty
                  reduction theory can be attributed to the consistent failure
                  to find support for deviance and incentive value as
                  determinants of tolerance for uncertainty, the rejection of
                  Axiom 3 in uncertainty reduction theory (which specifies a
                  positive relationship between uncertainty and information
                  seeking), and the rejection of Theorem 17 (which specifies a
                  negative relationship between information seeking and liking).},

                  opportunity to imagine and speculate on a product's or
                  experience's potentially positive characteristics. Research
                  has shown that when uncertainty is associated with something
                  positive, consumers may prefer uncertainty to certainty. In a
                  between-subjects experimental design with a large US (n = 446)
                  and Japanese sample (n = 453), the present study demonstrates
                  that positive uncertainty increases consumers’ positive
                  feelings when they evaluate a product, particularly for
                  high-involvement products that allow consumers to imagine and
                  speculate about potentially positive product benefits.
                  Unexpectedly, the study findings are consistent across the two
                  different markets, which vary substantially in terms of

                  results show that future-framed advertisements are effective
                  in generating positive uncertainty and that positive
                  uncertainty generates positive attitudes, both in countries

                  provides evidence for an important psychological antecedent to
                  this effect. Specifically, the authors find that the
                  likelihood of choosing a certain reward over a risky or
                  uncertain reward with a greater expected value is affected by
                  whether consumers attend to the gist of the choice options or
                  their associated details. Five experiments reveal that
                  shifting attention to the gist of the choice options
                  accentuates the preference for certainty and, conversely,
                  shifting attention to the details of the choice options
                  attenuates it. The authors provide convergent evidence for

                  that those who made the paintings would not change their

                  multilevel analysis was used in order to avoid biases caused
                  by common characteristics within a travel group. The scale
                  conceptualized sport nostalgia as a five-dimensional construct
                  reflecting sport tourists’ nostalgia of sport team,
                  environment, socialization, personal identity, and group
                  identity and showed adequate psychometric properties in

                  this article, we adopt a novel theoretical perspective of
                  doing so and test to what extent specific types of individuals
                  share similar risk profiles (i.e., configurations of
                  multidimensional risk preferences). To this end, we analyzed
                  data of a U.S. sample (N = 3,123) in a comprehensive and
                  rigorous way, resulting in a twofold contribution. First,
                  based on data from the Domain-Specific Risk-Taking scale
                  (DOSPERT) and using a cross-validation procedure, we
                  established a multidimensional trait space including general
                  and domain-specific dimensions of risk preference. Second, we
                  employed model-based cluster analyses in this multidimensional
                  trait space, finding that 66\% of participants can be
                  described well with four basic risk profiles. In sum, the
                  typological perspective proposed in this article has important
                  implications for current theories of risk preference and the

                  respond to performance feedback on multiple goals. Most of it
                  considers goals that have ambiguous ranking and thus differs
                  from goal hierarchies with sub‐goals that are instrumental for
                  accomplishing a primary goal. We develop theory on how goal
                  hierarchies lead to primary goal and sub‐goal interactions
                  influencing organizational decision‐making. We show that
                  sub‐goals are important because they are temporally prior and
                  instrumental for primary goals, making organizational
                  responses to sub‐goals and primary goal interdependent in
                  interesting ways. Empirically, we demonstrate a more
                  sophisticated approach to multiple goals than earlier work
                  suggests. This advances the behavioural theory of the firm,
                  and supports and refines key assumptions for organizational
                  design and organizational economics, encouraging further
                  research on the role of goal structures and incentive schemes.
                  Our theory and findings call for increased consideration of
                  the March and Simon's (1958) hierarchical goals’ model in

                  two non-independent selection pressures governing risk-taking:
                  need-based and ability-based. The need-based account suggests
                  that actors take risks when they cannot reach target states
                  with low-risk options (consistent with risk-sensitivity
                  theory). The ability-based account suggests that actors engage
                  in risk-taking when they possess traits or abilities that
                  increase the expected value of risk-taking (by increasing the
                  probability of success, enhancing payoffs for success or
                  buffering against failure). Adaptive risk-taking involves
                  integrating both considerations. Risk-takers compute the
                  expected value of risk-taking based on their state-the
                  interaction of embodied capital relative to one's situation,
                  to the same individual in other circumstances or to other
                  individuals. We provide mathematical support for this dual
                  pathway model, and show that it can predict who will take the
                  most risks and when (e.g. when risk-taking will be performed
                  by those in good, poor, intermediate or extreme state only).
                  Results confirm and elaborate on the initial verbal model of
                  state-dependent risk-taking: selection favours agents who
                  calibrate risk-taking based on implicit computations of
                  condition and/or competitive (dis)advantage, which in turn
                  drives patterned individual differences in risk-taking

               media, from classic novels to VR video games, from fictional
               stories to mediated sports. As becomes clear in this handbook,
               the history of entertainment research teaches us not to forget
               that even if a field is converging to a seemingly dominant
               perspective, paradigm, and methodology, there are more views,
               alternative approaches, and different yet equally illuminative
               ways of thinking about the field. Young scholars may find here
               innovative ways to reconcile empirical-theoretical approaches to
               the experience of entertainment with such alternative views. And
               there are numerous entertainment-related phenomena in
               contemporary societies that still fit the „bread and circuses-“
               perspective of the initial Frankfurt School thinking. So while
               the mission of the present handbook is to compile and advance
               current theories about media entertainment, scholars active or
               interested in the topic are invited to also consider the historic
               roots of the field and the great diversity it has featured over
               the past nearly 100 years. Many lessons can be learned from this
               history, and future innovations in entertainment theory may just
               as likely emerge from refining those approaches compiled in the
               present handbook as from building on neglected, forgotten, or
               marginalized streams of scholarship.},

                  identities, and forge strong bonds. Do these effects extend to
                  remote participation, and what are the psychological
                  mechanisms underpinning their social power? We monitored
                  psycho-physiological activity among groups of basketball fans
                  who either attended games in-person (in a stadium) or watched
                  games live on television in small groups. In-person attendance
                  was associated with greater synchronicity in autonomic nervous
                  system activation at the group level, which resulted in more
                  transformative experiences and contributed to stronger
                  identity fusion. Our findings suggest that the social effects
                  of sports depend substantially on the inter-personal dynamics
                  unfolding among fans, rather than being prompted simply by
                  watching the game itself. Given the increasing prevalence of
                  virtual experiences, this has potentially wide-reaching
                  implications for many domains of collective human interaction.},

                  participating in collective rituals promotes social cohesion.
                  The systematic testing and evaluation of this claim, however,
                  has been prevented by a lack of precision regarding the nature
                  of both “ritual” and “social cohesion” as well as a lack of
                  integration between the theories and findings of the social
                  and evolutionary sciences. By directly addressing these
                  challenges, we argue that a systematic investigation and
                  evaluation of the claim that ritual promotes social cohesion
                  is achievable. We present a general and testable theory of the
                  relationship between ritual, cohesion, and cooperation that
                  more precisely connects particular elements of “ritual,” such
                  as causal opacity and emotional arousal, to two particular
                  forms of “social cohesion”: group identification and identity
                  fusion. Further, we ground this theory in an evolutionary
                  account of why particular modes of ritual practice would be
                  adaptive for societies with particular resource-acquisition
                  strategies. In setting out our conceptual framework, we report
                  numerous ongoing investigations that test our hypotheses
                  against data from controlled psychological experiments as well

                  as did the circumstances surrounding the creation of the
                  original object and the duplicate. Overall, the results
                  support assessments of performance and contagion as key
                  factors underlying the value of original artwork, and they are
                  consistent with the conclusion that the discrepancy in value
                  between original artworks and perfect duplicates derives from
                  people's lay theories about the domain of art, rather than
                  from associations with particular kinds of art or certain
                  cases of forgery.},

  abstract     = {Theories of race relations have been shaped by the concept of
                  a racial hierarchy along which Whites are the most advantaged
                  and African Americans the most disadvantaged. However, the
                  recent precipitated growth of Latinos and Asian Americans in
                  the United States underscores the need for a framework that
                  integrates more groups. The current work proposes that racial
                  and ethnic minority groups are disadvantaged along 2 distinct
                  dimensions of perceived inferiority and perceived cultural
                  foreignness, such that the 4 largest groups in the United
                  States are located in 4 discrete quadrants: Whites are
                  perceived and treated as superior and American; African
                  Americans as inferior and relatively American compared with
                  Latinos and Asian Americans; Latinos as inferior and foreign;
                  and Asian Americans as foreign and relatively superior
                  compared to African Americans and Latinos. Support for this
                  Racial Position Model is first obtained from targets'
                  perspectives. Different groups experience distinct patterns of
                  racial prejudice that are predicted by their 2-dimensional
                  group positions (Studies 1 and 2). From perceivers'
                  perspectives, these group positions are reflected in the
                  content of racial stereotypes (Study 3), and are well-known
                  and consensually recognized (Study 4). Implications of this
                  new model for studying contemporary race relations (e.g.,
                  prejudice, threat, and interminority dynamics) are discussed.

                  and to reveal possible individual factors predicting such
                  negative bias. A total of 201 participants completed a survey,
                  rating images on liking, perceived positive emotion, and
                  believed human or AI origin. The findings of the study showed
                  that some individual characteristics as creative personal

                  that were, until recently, reserved for humans, such as, for
                  instance, art. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is
                  not much empirical evidence on how people perceive the skills
                  of AI in these domains. In Experiment 1, participants were
                  exposed to AI-generated audiovisual artwork and were asked to
                  evaluate it. We told half of the participants that the artist
                  was a human and we confessed to the other half that it was an
                  AI. Although all of them were exposed to the same artwork, the
                  results showed that people attributed lower sensitivity, lower
                  ability to evoke their emotions, and lower quality to the
                  artwork when they thought the artist was AI as compared to
                  when they believed the artist was human. Experiment 2
                  reproduced these results and extended them to a slightly
                  different setting, a different piece of (exclusively auditory)
                  artwork, and added some additional measures. The results show
                  that the evaluation of art seems to be modulated, at least in
                  part, by prior stereotypes and biases about the creative
                  skills of AI. The data and materials for these experiments are

                  becomes a feature of everyday life, it is important to
                  understand how creative acts, regarded as uniquely human, can
                  be valued if produced by a machine. The current studies sought
                  to investigate how observers respond to works of visual art
                  created either by humans or by computers. Study 1 tested
                  observers’ ability to discriminate between computer-generated
                  and man-made art, and then examined how categorisation of art
                  works impacted on perceived aesthetic value, revealing a bias
                  against computer-generated art. In Study 2 this bias was
                  reproduced in the context of robotic art, however it was found
                  to be reversed when observers were given the opportunity to
                  see robotic artists in action. These findings reveal an
                  explicit prejudice against computergenerated art, driven

                  algorithms are capable of producing. These prejudices can be
                  overridden in circumstances in which observers are able to
                  infer anthropomorphic characteristics in the computer

  abstract     = {Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have significantly
                  improved the abilities of machines. Human-unique abilities,
                  such as art creation, are now being challenged by AI. Recent
                  studies have investigated and compared people's attitudes
                  toward human-made and AI-generated artworks. These results
                  suggest that a negative bias may exist toward the latter.
                  However, none of these previous studies has examined the
                  extent of this bias. In this study, we investigate whether a
                  bias against AI art can be found at an implicit level.
                  Viewers' attitudes toward AI art were assessed using
                  eye-tracking measures and subjective aesthetic evaluations.
                  Visual attention and aesthetic judgments were compared between
                  artworks categorized as human-made and AI-made. The results
                  showed that although it was difficult for individuals to
                  identify AI-generated artwork, they exhibited an implicit
                  prejudice against AI art. Participants looked longer at
                  paintings that they thought were made by humans. No
                  significant effect of categorization of paintings was found in
                  subjective evaluations. These findings suggest that although
                  human and AI art may be perceived as having similar aesthetic
                  values, an implicit negative bias toward AI art exists.
                  Although AI can now perform creative tasks, artistic
                  creativity is still considered a human prerogative.},

                  outcomes can change how diagnostic success or failure are
                  regarding the competence of an individual or a firm.
                  Succeeding under adverse circumstances is especially
                  impressive when initial failure reduces the chances of success
                  more for low-quality agents than for high-quality agents.
                  Succeeding after initial failure (being a “successful
                  underdog”) can also indicate higher expected quality than
                  succeeding twice if initial success increases the chances of
                  success of all agents to a high level. In different
                  circumstances, the outcome after success can be especially
                  informative about quality, implying that failing after an
                  initial success (a “one-hit wonder”) indicates lower quality
                  than failing twice does. We find effects consistent with our

                  quality. The results help to clarify when failure should be
                  attributed to the person in charge or to the situation, when
                  underdogs and individuals who overcome adversity are
                  especially impressive and when a naïve “more is better”

                  attraction. Drawing on a survey of 704 members of a social

                  passive, and interactive strategies to reduce uncertainty
                  about their new acquaintance. Interactive strategies were most
                  effective in reducing uncertainty about the target person.

                  dimensions of self-disclosure (honesty, amount, intent, and

                  article shows how this sequential sampling feature of
                  impression formation can explain several biases in impression
                  formation. The underlying mechanism is the sample bias
                  generated when the probability of interaction depends on
                  current impressions. Because negative experiences decrease the
                  probability of interaction, negative initial impressions are
                  more stable than positive impressions. Negative initial
                  impressions, however, are more likely to change for
                  individuals who are frequently exposed to others. As a result,
                  systematic differences in interaction patterns, due to social
                  similarity or proximity, will produce systematic differences
                  in impressions. This mechanism suggests an alternative
                  explanation of several regularities in impression formation,
                  including a negativity bias in impressions of outgroup

                  experience of time—is an essential concept for understanding
                  how individuals, teams, and organizations evolve, grow, learn,
                  and change. Yet most management research and literature
                  reviews have typically emphasized objective time to the
                  exclusion of subjective time. Our review focuses on this
                  lesser studied “other” time, beginning with a review of how
                  seminal articles on time have historically conceptualized
                  subjective time. From this initial review, we offer an
                  integrative and multilevel definition of subjective time as
                  the experience of the past, present, and future, which occurs
                  as individuals and collectives mentally travel through,
                  perceive, and interpret time. Then, using this new definition
                  to frame the remainder of the review, we examine the
                  literature employing subjective time concepts to address three
                  key questions: what is subjective time, how does it operate,
                  and why does it matter? Our analysis provides new ways to
                  understand subjective time and the important role it plays in
                  organizational phenomena. We conclude by challenging
                  management scholars to consider three priorities for future
                  research: the fundamental relationship between subjective time
                  and meaning, the unclear nature of event time, and the ways in
                  which objective time is dependent upon subjective time.},

  abstract     = {This paper reports on a field study of strategy making in one
                  organization facing an industry crisis. In a comparison of
                  five strategy projects, we observed that organizational
                  participants struggled with competing interpretations of what
                  might emerge in the future, what was currently at stake, and
                  even what had happened in the past. We develop a model of
                  temporal work in strategy making that articulates how actors
                  resolved differences and linked their interpretations of the
                  past, present, and future so as to construct a strategic
                  account that enabled concrete strategic choice and action. We
                  found that settling on a particular account required it to be
                  coherent, plausible, and acceptable; otherwise, breakdowns
                  resulted. Such breakdowns could impede progress, but they
                  could also be generative in provoking a search for new
                  interpretations and possibilities for action. The more
                  intensely actors engaged in temporal work, the more likely the
                  strategies departed from the status quo. Our model suggests
                  that strategy cannot be understood as the product of more or
                  less accurate forecasting without considering the multiple
                  interpretations of present concerns and historical
                  trajectories that help to constitute those forecasts.
                  Projections of the future are always entangled with views of
                  the past and present, and temporal work is the means by which
                  actors construct and reconstruct the connections among them.
                  These insights into the mechanisms of strategy making help
                  explain the practices and conditions that produce
                  organizational inertia and change.},

                  held assumption that perceptions of organizational

                  and generative AI, there are four primary paradigms for
                  human–AI collaboration: human-only, AI-only (ChatGPT-4),
                  augmented human (where a human makes the final decision with
                  AI output as a reference), or augmented AI (where the AI makes
                  the final decision with human output as a reference). In
                  partnership with one of the world’s leading consulting firms,
                  we enlisted professional content creators and ChatGPT-4 to
                  create advertising content for products and persuasive content
                  for campaigns following the aforementioned paradigms. First,
                  we find that, contrary to the expectations of some of the
                  existing algorithm aversion literature on conventional
                  predictive AI, the content generated by generative AI and
                  augmented AI is perceived as of higher quality than that
                  produced by human experts and augmented human experts. Second,
                  revealing the source of content production reduces—but does
                  not reverse—the perceived quality gap between human- and
                  AI-generated content. This bias in evaluation is predominantly
                  driven by human favoritism rather than AI aversion: Knowing
                  that the same content is created by a human expert increases
                  its (reported) perceived quality, but knowing that AI is
                  involved in the creation process does not affect its perceived
                  quality. Further analysis suggests this bias is not due to a
                  ‘quality prime’ as knowing the content they are about to
                  evaluate comes from competent creators (e.g., industry
                  professionals and state-of-the-art AI) without knowing exactly
                  that the creator of each piece of content does not increase
                  participants’ perceived quality.},

                  information about the providers they consider working with and
                  hiring (e.g., realtors, designers), including how they spend
                  their free time. This research examines how a professional’s
                  disclosure of their leisure activities impacts consumer
                  choice. While the way people spend their leisure time should
                  be unrelated to their professional aptitude, across an online
                  field study and four lab studies, the authors demonstrate that
                  disclosing leisure activities associated with eudaimonic
                  well-being (ie, meaning, fulfillment), such as hiking or
                  cooking, can positively impact consumer choice. Such
                  disclosures, relative to either not disclosing leisure or
                  disclosing less eudaimonic activities such as relaxing or
                  watching television, increase perceptions of competence, and
                  in turn, interest in choosing, hiring, and supporting these
                  individuals. Notably, the effects of eudaimonic leisure on
                  competence and hiring intentions are attenuated if other
                  diagnostic competence cues are present, such as a job- related
                  award, and among those who value productivity less (ie, have a
                  low productivity orientation). Thus, the authors show how
                  seemingly irrelevant personal information about professionals
                  can inform consumer choice. Moreover, by manipulating
                  eudaimonic well-being via leisure disclosures, they
                  demonstrate how such cues impact person perception,
                  integrating research on well-being, self-disclosure, and
                  social perceptions.},

                  spending time on meaningful activities rather than pleasurable
                  ones, whereas the opposite is true for individuals with high
                  trait hedonic capacity. In Studies 1a and 1b, participants
                  either imagined ( N = 449) or actually engaged in activities (
                  N = 231, pre-registered) during unexpected free time. They
                  then rated their experience. In both studies, trait
                  self-control was positively related to the eudaimonic
                  experience (e.g., meaning) of activities and unrelated to
                  their hedonic experience (e.g., pleasure). The opposite was
                  true for trait hedonic capacity. Study 2 ( N = 248) confirmed
                  these findings using a repeated-choice paradigm. The

  abstract     = {Previous literature has suggested a significant association
                  between loneliness and depression. Importantly, research has
                  shown that rumination can modulate the loneliness–depression
                  relationship. However, most studies only treated loneliness,
                  rumination or depression as unitary constructs. Considering
                  the heterogeneity of the three concepts, we examined the
                  relationship between specific loneliness, rumination items and
                  depressive symptoms using the network analysis approach. In a
                  large community adult sample (N = 900), we constructed the
                  loneliness–depression and loneliness–rumination–depression
                  network using a cross-sectional design. The results suggested
                  that loneliness has no robust association with depressive
                  symptoms. Instead, a connection between a specific ruminative
                  thought (‘think about how alone you are’) and a specific
                  loneliness item (‘how often do you feel alone’) is essential
                  in maintaining the loneliness–rumination–depression network
                  (partial r = 0.307). Our findings indicate that ruminating on
                  the feeling of loneliness is the key underlying factor
                  modulating the loneliness–depression relationship.
                  Interventions for depression should focus on ameliorating
                  ruminative thoughts, especially on loneliness feelings. In a
                  network analysis investigating associations among loneliness,
                  rumination and depressive symptoms, the authors find that
                  ruminating specifically on loneliness modulated the

                  self-regulation suggest that monitoring goal progress is a
                  crucial process that intervenes between setting and attaining
                  a goal, and helps to ensure that goals are translated into
                  action. However, the impact of progress monitoring
                  interventions on rates of behavioral performance and goal
                  attainment has yet to be quantified. A systematic literature
                  search identified 138 studies (N = 19,951) that randomly
                  allocated participants to an intervention designed to promote
                  monitoring of goal progress versus a control condition. All
                  studies reported the effects of the treatment on (a) the
                  frequency of progress monitoring and (b) subsequent goal
                  attainment. A random effects model revealed that, on average,
                  interventions were successful at increasing the frequency of
                  monitoring goal progress (d+ = 1.98, 95\% CI [1.71, 2.24]) and
                  promoted goal attainment (d+ = 0.40, 95\% CI [0.32, 0.48]).
                  Furthermore, changes in the frequency of progress monitoring
                  mediated the effect of the interventions on goal attainment.
                  Moderation tests revealed that progress monitoring had larger
                  effects on goal attainment when the outcomes were reported or
                  made public, and when the information was physically recorded.
                  Taken together, the findings suggest that monitoring goal
                  progress is an effective self-regulation strategy, and that
                  interventions that increase the frequency of progress
                  monitoring are likely to promote behavior change.},

                  social scenarios are seen as less likable. This is because,
                  depending on the social context, response ambiguity may be
                  interpreted as a way to conceal the truth and as a sign of
                  social disinterest. Consequently, people reported lower
                  inclination to befriend or date individuals who appeared to
                  provide ambiguous responses. We also identified situations in
                  which response ambiguity does not harm likability, such as
                  when the questions are sensitive and the responder may need to
                  "soften the blow." A final exploratory study showed that

                  context, including a debate as to the legitimacy of the brand

                  the phenomenological significance of consumer-brand bonds; (2)
                  provides a framework for characterizing and better
                  understanding the types of relationships consumers form with

                  socially distant relationships or when givers provide

                  investigate gifts with choices, unveiling a unique
                  giver–recipient disagreement, and exploring its underlying

                  that decision makers face jointly determine organizational
                  risk-taking choices. While the behavioral theory of the firm
                  has identified performance feedback’s important role in
                  driving organizational risk-taking decisions, it has not
                  considered the intrinsic attributes of alternatives,
                  specifically the magnitude and likelihood of their outcomes,
                  which have been the focus of prospect theory. We argue that
                  these two attributes play a key role in decision makers’
                  assessment of alternatives, but because achieving
                  organizational goals is the prime objective in organizations,
                  performance feedback drives how decision makers process
                  information regarding these attributes. Analyzing 23,895
                  fourth-down decisions from the U.S. National Football League,

                  finding that gender differences in personality are at their
                  largest in the most gender equal countries. Previous known
                  studies have not examined this relationship over time.
                  Examining this linkage is crucial to our understanding of
                  gender differences and personality development. In the present
                  study, we contrast evolutionary perspectives predicting a
                  gender divergence in personality due to progression in gender
                  equality against biosocial perspectives predicting
                  convergence. Using data from all eight rounds of the European
                  Social Survey (n = 235,339) across 32 European countries, we
                  report three findings. First, in accordance with the
                  evolutionary perspective, country-level gender equality is
                  positively associated with gender differences in basic human
                  values. Second, in accordance with the biosocial perspective,
                  we find evidence supporting gender convergence in basic human
                  values. Third, contradicting both evolutionary and biosocial
                  assumptions, we find no evidence that gender equality causes
                  gender differences in values. We argue that there is a need to
                  explore alternative explanations to the observed
                  cross-sectional association between gender equality and
                  personality differences, as well as gender convergence in
                  personality over time.},

                  Using an international database on adolescent achievement in
                  science, mathematics, and reading ( N = 472,242), we showed

                  the magnitude of relative academic strengths and pursuit of

                  meta-analyses to demonstrate that males and females are highly
                  similar. Nonetheless, the gender similarities hypothesis has
                  remained controversial. Since Hyde's provocative report, there
                  has been an explosion of meta-analytic interest in
                  psychological gender differences. We utilized this enormous
                  collection of 106 meta-analyses and 386 individual
                  meta-analytic effects to reevaluate the gender similarities
                  hypothesis. Furthermore, we employed a novel data-analytic
                  approach called metasynthesis (Zell \& Krizan, 2014) to
                  estimate the average difference between males and females and
                  to explore moderators of gender differences. The average,
                  absolute difference between males and females across domains
                  was relatively small (d = 0.21, SD = 0.14), with the majority
                  of effects being either small (46\%) or very small (39\%).
                  Magnitude of differences fluctuated somewhat as a function of
                  the psychological domain (e.g., cognitive variables, social
                  and personality variables, well-being), but remained largely
                  constant across age, culture, and generations. These findings
                  provide compelling support for the gender similarities

                  individual differences in change in religiosity. However, no
                  research to date has examined whether within-person changes in
                  personality lead to subsequent changes in religiosity. Using
                  random intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPM), we
                  investigated between- and within-person associations between
                  the Big Five personality traits and three aspects of
                  religiosity-belief in God, service attendance, and prayer-in a
                  sample of over 12,000 Dutch individuals across 11 annual
                  assessments. We found between-person associations between all
                  Big Five traits and religiosity, yet within-person
                  associations only between agreeableness as well as
                  extraversion and belief in God. Specifically, individuals who
                  increased in agreeableness or extraversion reported subsequent
                  increases in their belief in God and, in addition, individuals
                  who increased in their belief in God showed subsequent
                  increases in agreeableness. We further identified significant
                  moderating effects of gender, religious upbringing, and
                  religious affiliation. Overall, the present findings suggest
                  that the associations between personality traits and
                  religiosity primarily occur at the between-person level.
                  However, the evidence for intraindividual associations between
                  agreeableness, extraversion, and religious belief highlights
                  the importance of distinguishing between-person from
                  within-person effects to broaden the understanding of the
                  temporal dynamics between variables. (PsycInfo Database Record

                  context, and others, which are not restricted to a social
                  context, can be affected by the social interactions with
                  conspecifics. In this paper, we focus on the recently proposed
                  hypothesis that social niche specialization (i.e. individuals
                  in a population occupy different social roles) can explain the
                  maintenance of individual differences in personality. We first
                  present ecological and social niche specialization hypotheses.
                  In particular, we show how niche specialization can be
                  quantified and highlight the link between personality
                  differences and social niche specialization. We then review
                  some ecological factors (e.g. competition and environmental
                  heterogeneity) and the social mechanisms (e.g.
                  frequency-dependent, state-dependent and social awareness)
                  that may be associated with the evolution of social niche
                  specialization and personality differences. Finally, we
                  present a conceptual model and methods to quantify the
                  contribution of ecological factors and social mechanisms to
                  the dynamics between personality and social roles. In doing
                  so, we suggest a series of research objectives to help

                  of a single choice: they assimilate to their group on one
                  dimension (by conforming on identity-signaling attributes such
                  as brand) while differentiating on another dimension
                  (distinguishing themselves on uniqueness attributes such as
                  color). Desires to communicate social identity lead consumers
                  to conform on choice dimensions that are strongly associated
                  with their group, particularly in identity-relevant consumer
                  categories such as clothing. Higher needs for uniqueness lead
                  consumers to differentiate within groups by choosing less

                  group. By examining both between- and within-group levels of

  abstract     = {A behavioral syndrome is a suite of correlated behaviors
                  expressed either within a given behavioral context (e.g.,
                  correlations between foraging behaviors in different habitats)
                  or across different contexts (e.g., correlations among
                  feeding, antipredator, mating, aggressive, and dispersal
                  behaviors). For example, some individuals (and genotypes)
                  might be generally more aggressive, more active or bold, while
                  others are generally less aggressive, active or bold. This
                  phenomenon has been studied in detail in humans, some
                  primates, laboratory rodents, and some domesticated animals,
                  but has rarely been studied in other organisms, and rarely
                  examined from an evolutionary or ecological perspective. Here,
                  we present an integrative overview on the potential importance
                  of behavioral syndromes in evolution and ecology. A central
                  idea is that behavioral correlations generate tradeoffs; for
                  example, an aggressive genotype might do well in situations
                  where high aggression is favored, but might be inappropriately
                  aggressive in situations where low aggression is favored (and
                  vice versa for a low aggression genotype). Behavioral
                  syndromes can thereby result in maladaptive behavior in some
                  contexts, and potentially maintain individual variation in
                  behavior in a variable environment. We suggest terminology and
                  methods for studying behavioral syndromes, review examples,
                  discuss evolutionary and proximate approaches for
                  understanding behavioral syndromes, note insights from human
                  personality research, and outline some potentially important
                  ecological implications. Overall, we suggest that behavioral
                  syndromes could play a useful role as an integrative bridge
                  between genetics, experience, neuroendocrine mechanisms,
                  evolution, and ecology.},

                  in ways that do not maximize individual energetic return
                  rates. As an alternative to hypotheses that rely on reciprocal
                  altruism to counter the costs of inefficiency, we suggest that
                  the cost itself could be recouped through signal benefit.
                  Costly signaling theory predicts that signals can provide
                  fitness benefits when costs are honestly linked to signaler
                  quality, and this information is broadcast to potential mates
                  and competitors. Here, we test some predictions of costly
                  signaling theory against empirical data on human food
                  acquisition and sharing patterns. We show that at least two
                  types of marine foraging, turtle hunting and spearfishing, as
                  practiced among the Meriam (a Melanesian people of Torres
                  Strait, Australia) meet key criteria for costly signaling:
                  signal traits are (1) differentially costly or beneficial in
                  ways that are (2) honestly linked to signaler quality, and (3)
                  designed to effectively broadcast the signal. We conclude that
                  relatively inefficient hunting or sharing choices may be
                  maintained in a population if they serve as costly and
                  reliable signals designed to reveal the signaler's qualities
                  to observers.},

                  transitory psychological states, such as emotional states?
                  Convergent validity refers to the degree to which different
                  measures of a psychological construct capture a common
                  underlying characteristic or trait. Do measures of risk
                  preference all capture a unitary psychological trait that is
                  indicative of risky behavior across various domains, or do
                  they capture various traits that independently contribute to
                  risky behavior in specific areas of life, such as financial,
                  health, and recreational domains? Predictive validity refers
                  to the extent to which a psychological trait has power in
                  forecasting behavior. Intelligence and major personality
                  traits have been shown to predict important life outcomes,
                  such as academic and professional achievement, which suggests
                  there could be studies of the short- and long-term outcomes of
                  risk preference— something lacking in current psychological
                  (and economic) research. We discuss the current empirical
                  knowledge on risk preferences in light of these

  abstract     = {Modern theories in cognitive psychology and neuroscience
                  indicate that there are two fundamental ways in which human
                  beings comprehend risk. The "analytic system" uses algorithms
                  and normative rules, such as probability calculus, formal
                  logic, and risk assessment. It is relatively slow, effortful,
                  and requires conscious control. The "experiential system" is
                  intuitive, fast, mostly automatic, and not very accessible to
                  conscious awareness. The experiential system enabled human
                  beings to survive during their long period of evolution and
                  remains today the most natural and most common way to respond
                  to risk. It relies on images and associations, linked by
                  experience to emotion and affect (a feeling that something is
                  good or bad). This system represents risk as a feeling that
                  tells us whether it is safe to walk down this dark street or
                  drink this strange-smelling water. Proponents of formal risk
                  analysis tend to view affective responses to risk as
                  irrational. Current wisdom disputes this view. The rational
                  and the experiential systems operate in parallel and each
                  seems to depend on the other for guidance. Studies have
                  demonstrated that analytic reasoning cannot be effective
                  unless it is guided by emotion and affect. Rational decision
                  making requires proper integration of both modes of thought.
                  Both systems have their advantages, biases, and limitations.
                  Now that we are beginning to understand the complex interplay
                  between emotion and reason that is essential to rational
                  behavior, the challenge before us is to think creatively about
                  what this means for managing risk. On the one hand, how do we
                  apply reason to temper the strong emotions engendered by some
                  risk events? On the other hand, how do we infuse needed "doses
                  of feeling" into circumstances where lack of experience may
                  otherwise leave us too "coldly rational"? This article
                  addresses these important questions.},

                  bring about changes in their environments, many of which are
                  evolutionarily and ecologically consequential. Advocates of
                  niche construction theory (NCT) believe that standard
                  evolutionary theory fails to recognize the full importance of
                  niche construction, and consequently propose a novel view of
                  evolution, in which niche construction and its legacy over
                  time (ecological inheritance) are described as evolutionary
                  processes, equivalent in importance to natural selection.
                  Here, we subject NCT to critical evaluation, in the form of a
                  collaboration between one prominent advocate of NCT, and a
                  team of skeptics. We discuss whether niche construction is an
                  evolutionary process, whether NCT obscures or clarifies how
                  natural selection leads to organismal adaptation, and whether
                  niche construction and natural selection are of equivalent
                  explanatory importance. We also consider whether the
                  literature that promotes NCT overstates the significance of
                  niche construction, whether it is internally coherent, and
                  whether it accurately portrays standard evolutionary theory.
                  Our disagreements reflect a wider dispute within evolutionary
                  theory over whether the neo-Darwinian synthesis is in need of
                  reformulation, as well as different usages of some key terms

                  seeking. Our stochastic variety-seeking model SVS has nested
                  within it a fixed variety-seeking model, a zero-order model of
                  choice, and a first-order "pure variety" model. We compare the
                  SVS model to alternative models. Under stochastic variety
                  seeking, we examine the nature of the variety sought and
                  provide a test of the "satiation" hypothesis. Unlike fixed
                  variety-seeking models, our model allows variety seeking to
                  vary in intensity and consistency over individuals as well as
                  over purchase occasions. We show that the model is equivalent
                  to a random utility model with the features that the
                  attributes of brands relative to those of the brand previously
                  bought influence choice, and the extent of variety seeking is
                  random over choice occasions for a given individual. The model
                  permits a closed-form solution to the conditional switching
                  probabilities parameterized by variety-seeking parameters, and
                  dependent on brand attributes. We apply our model to

                  of self-presentation, possessions, and computer-mediated
                  environments (CMEs), we investigate the ways in which
                  consumers construct identities by digitally associating
                  themselves with signs, symbols, material objects, and places.
                  Specifically, the issues of interest include why consumers
                  create personal Web sites, what consumers want to communicate,
                  what strategies they devise to achieve their goal of
                  self-presentation, and how those Web space strategies compare
                  to the self-presentation strategies of real life (RL). The
                  data reveal insights into the strategies behind constructing a
                  digital self, projecting a digital likeness, digitally
                  associating as a new form of possession, and reorganizing

                  the role of consumers' need for uniqueness (CNFU) in two
                  common social comparisons: projection and introjection.
                  Consumers project (i.e., rely on their own preferences to
                  estimate those of others), regardless of their CNFU. However,
                  high-CNFU consumers are less likely than low-CNFU ones to
                  introject (i.e., rely on estimates of others' preferences to
                  gauge their own). Moreover, alleviating the
                  introjection-induced threat to the high-CNFU consumers'
                  self-concept by having them deliberate on their differentness
                  from others increases their likelihood of introjection.
                  Together, these findings confirm our basic contention that the
                  process underlying introjection is more motivational in nature

  abstract     = {AbstractNiche construction theory (NCT) aims to transform and
                  unite evolutionary biology and ecology. Much of the debate
                  about NCT has focused on construction. Less attention has been
                  accorded to the niche: what is it, exactly, that organisms are
                  constructing? In this paper I compare and contrast the
                  definition of the niche used in NCT with ecological niche
                  definitions. NCT’s concept of the evolutionary niche is
                  defined as the sum of selection pressures affecting a
                  population. So defined, the evolutionary niche is narrower
                  than the ecological niche. Moreover, when contrasted with a
                  more restricted ecological niche concept, it has a slightly
                  different extension. I point out three kinds of cases in which
                  the evolutionary niche does not coincide with realized
                  ecological niches: extreme habitat degradation, commensalism,
                  and non-limiting or super-abundant resources. These conceptual
                  differences affect the role of NCT in unifying ecology and
                  evolutionary biology.},

                  when women are most fertile—can shift women’s mating
                  psychology and increase their desire for new options in men.
                  However, might ovulation also increase women’s desire for new
                  products? Four studies find that women select a greater number
                  of unique options from consumer product sets at high
                  fertility. This effect is especially strong for women in
                  committed relationships. Additional findings show that the
                  fertility shift in desire for variety in products is driven by
                  the fertility shift in desire for new options in men
                  activating a variety-seeking mind-set. Subsequently, loyalty
                  to a romantic partner, whether manipulated or measured,
                  moderated the effect of fertility on consumer variety seeking.

                  acceptance of solid foods by infants during weaning is
                  enhanced by early experiences with flavor variety. OBJECTIVE:
                  We tested the hypotheses that the acceptance of novel foods by
                  formula-fed infants could be facilitated by providing the
                  infants with a variety of flavors at the time when beikost is
                  first introduced and that, contrary to medical lore, infants
                  who had previously consumed fruit would be less likely to
                  reject vegetables when first introduced than would infants
                  without such an experience. DESIGN: The infants' acceptance of
                  a novel vegetable (puréed carrot) and a novel meat (puréed
                  chicken) was evaluated after a 9-d exposure period in 3 groups
                  of infants, some of whom had previously consumed fruit. During
                  the home-exposure period, one group was fed only carrots, the
                  target vegetable; a second group was fed only potatoes, a
                  vegetable that differed in flavor from carrots; and a third
                  group was fed a variety of vegetables that did not include
                  carrots. RESULTS: Infants fed either carrots or a variety of
                  vegetables, but not those fed potatoes, ate significantly more
                  of the carrots after the exposure period. Exposure to a
                  variety of vegetables also facilitated the acceptance of the
                  novel food, puréed chicken, and daily experience with fruit
                  enhanced the infants' initial acceptance of carrots.
                  CONCLUSION: These findings are the first experimental evidence
                  to indicate that exposure to a variety of flavors enhances
                  acceptance of novel foods in human infants.},

                  context wherein group members voice their choices
                  sequentially. In this article we examine the impact of this
                  dynamic decision process on individuals' choices and
                  satisfaction with their outcomes. We propose that choices
                  reflect a balancing of two classes of goals: goals that are
                  strictly individual and goals that are triggered by the
                  existence of the group. The latter sometimes results in
                  choices that undermine personal satisfaction and increase
                  regret. We find support for goal balancing in three studies in
                  which we tracked consumers' orders of dishes and drinks. In
                  the Lunch study we found that real groups (tables) choose more
                  varied dishes than would be expected by random sampling of the
                  population of all individual choices across all tables. The
                  Beer study demonstrates that this group-level variety seeking
                  is attributable to the interaction—implicit or explicit—among
                  group members, and can be dissipated when the group is forced
                  to “disband” and its members make strictly individual choices.
                  Finally, the Wine study demonstrated that individual choices
                  in a group context are also aimed at satisfying goals of
                  information gathering and self-presentation in the form of
                  uniqueness.},

                  recognised since antiquity. Nevertheless, the ecological and
                  evolutionary significance of such variation is attracting
                  widespread interest, which is burgeoning to an extent that is
                  fragmenting the literature. As a first attempt at synthesis,
                  we focus on individual differences in behaviour within
                  populations that exceed the day-to-day variation in individual
                  behaviour (i.e. behavioural specialisation). Indeed, the
                  factors promoting ecologically relevant behavioural
                  specialisation within natural populations are likely to have
                  far-reaching ecological and evolutionary consequences. We
                  discuss such individual differences from three distinct
                  perspectives: individual niche specialisations, the division
                  of labour within insect societies and animal personality
                  variation. In the process, while recognising that each area
                  has its own unique motivations, we identify a number of
                  opportunities for productive 'cross-fertilisation' among the
                  (largely independent) bodies of work. We conclude that a
                  complete understanding of evolutionarily and ecologically
                  relevant individual differences must specify how ecological
                  interactions impact the basic biological process (e.g.
                  Darwinian selection, development and information processing)
                  that underpin the organismal features determining behavioural
                  specialisations. Moreover, there is likely to be co-variation
                  amongst behavioural specialisations. Thus, we sketch the key
                  elements of a general framework for studying the evolutionary
                  ecology of individual differences.},

                  who perceive low economic mobility (i.e., economically stuck
                  consumers) seek more variety than other consumers. We trace
                  this effect to these consumers’ desire to compensate for their
                  low sense of personal control. Furthermore, we show that these
                  consumers’ variety-seeking tendency disappears when their
                  sense of control is boosted by other means or when the more
                  varied option is not associated with a sense of control.

                  having limited discretionary time actually detrimental? And
                  can there be downsides of having too much discretionary time?
                  In two large-scale data sets spanning 35,375 Americans and two
                  experiments, we explore the relationship between the amount of
                  discretionary time individuals have and their subjective
                  well-being. We find and internally replicate a negative
                  quadratic relationship between discretionary time and
                  subjective well-being. These results show that whereas having
                  too little time is indeed linked to lower subjective
                  well-being caused by stress, having more time does not
                  continually translate to greater subjective well-being. Having
                  an abundance of discretionary time is sometimes even linked to
                  lower subjective well-being because of a lacking sense of

                  much discretionary time can be attenuated when people spend
                  this time on productive activities. (PsycInfo Database Record

                  experiences result in the greatest happiness? The current
                  investigation is one of the first to categorize types of
                  experiences and highlights one important distinction: the
                  extent to which an experience is ordinary (common and
                  frequent) versus extraordinary (uncommon and infrequent).
                  Eight studies examine the experiences individuals recall,
                  plan, imagine, and post on Facebook finding that the happiness
                  enjoyed from ordinary and extraordinary experiences depends on
                  age. Younger people, who view their future as extensive, gain
                  more happiness from extraordinary experiences; however,
                  ordinary experiences become increasingly associated with
                  happiness as people get older, such that they produce as much
                  happiness as extraordinary experiences when individuals have
                  limited time remaining. Self-definition drives these effects:
                  although extraordinary experiences are self-defining
                  throughout one's life span, as people get older they
                  increasingly define themselves by the ordinary experiences

                  variety than if they make separate choices immediately
                  preceding consumption. This phenomenon is explored in a series
                  of experiments in which the researchers first eliminated
                  several hypotheses that held that the discrepancy between
                  combined and separate choice can be explained by traditional
                  accounts of utility maximization. On the basis of results of
                  further experiments, it was concluded that the diversification
                  bias is largely attributable to 2 mechanisms: time
                  contraction, which is the tendency to compress time intervals
                  and treat long intervals as if they were short, and choice
                  bracketing, which is the tendency to treat choices that are

                  manipulated the number of repeated measures (3, 4, and 6) and
                  sample size (from 10 to 300), with ε\textasciicircum values
                  ranging from the lower to its upper limit. Results: Overall,
                  the results showed that the F-statistic becomes more liberal
                  as sphericity violation increases, whereas both F-HF and F-GG
                  control Type I error; of the two, F-GG is more conservative,
                  especially with large values of ε\textasciicircum and small
                  samples. Discussion: If different statistical conclusions
                  follow from application of the two tests, we recommend using
                  F-GG for ε\textasciicircum values below 0.60, and F-HF for
                  ε\textasciicircum values equal to or above 0.60.},

  abstract     = {An important step when designing an empirical study is to
                  justify the sample size that will be collected. The key aim of
                  a sample size justification for such studies is to explain how
                  the collected data is expected to provide valuable information
                  given the inferential goals of the researcher. In this
                  overview article six approaches are discussed to justify the
                  sample size in a quantitative empirical study: 1) collecting
                  data from (almost) the entire population, 2) choosing a sample
                  size based on resource constraints, 3) performing an a-priori
                  power analysis, 4) planning for a desired accuracy, 5) using
                  heuristics, or 6) explicitly acknowledging the absence of a
                  justification. An important question to consider when
                  justifying sample sizes is which effect sizes are deemed
                  interesting, and the extent to which the data that is
                  collected informs inferences about these effect sizes.
                  Depending on the sample size justification chosen, researchers
                  could consider 1) what the smallest effect size of interest
                  is, 2) which minimal effect size will be statistically
                  significant, 3) which effect sizes they expect (and what they
                  base these expectations on), 4) which effect sizes would be
                  rejected based on a confidence interval around the effect
                  size, 5) which ranges of effects a study has sufficient power
                  to detect based on a sensitivity power analysis, and 6) which
                  effect sizes are expected in a specific research area.
                  Researchers can use the guidelines presented in this article,
                  for example by using the interactive form in the accompanying
                  online Shiny app, to improve their sample size justification,
                  and hopefully, align the informational value of a study with
                  their inferential goals.},

                  of the methodological and theoretical issues currently being
                  dealt with by behavioural ecologists within the context of
                  behavioural syndromes have previously been investigated by

                  including complex diseases. Such variation among organisms
                  with virtually identical chromosomal DNA sequences has largely
                  been attributed to the effects of environment. Environmental
                  factors can have a strong effect on some phenotypes, but
                  evidence from both animal and human experiments suggests that
                  the impact of environment has been overstated and that our
                  views on the causes of phenotypic differences in genetically

                  experimental opportunities arise if epigenetic factors are

                  time. The Dickens and Flynn model of increases in cognitive
                  ability over generational time, for example, suggests that
                  small changes in phenotype can lead to subsequent reallocation

                  local environments, such as nests, burrows, pupal cases,
                  chemicals, and nutrients. A small but increasing number of
                  evolutionary biologists regard niche construction as an
                  evolutionary process in its own right, rather than as a mere
                  product of natural selection. Through niche construction
                  organisms not only influence the nature of their world, but
                  also in part determine the selection pressures to which they
                  and their descendants are exposed, and they do so in a
                  non-random manner. Mathematical population genetics analyses
                  have revealed that niche construction is likely to be
                  evolutionarily consequential because of the feedback that it
                  generates in the evolutionary process. A parallel movement has

                  utility of regarding organisms as ecosystem engineers, who

                  reciprocal interacting processes of natural selection and

                  processes, modify natural selection and contribute to
                  inheritance through ecological legacies. Here, we propose that
                  niche construction initiates and modifies the selection
                  directly affecting the constructor, and on other species, in
                  an orderly, directed and sustained manner. By dependably
                  generating specific environmental states, niche construction
                  co-directs adaptive evolution by imposing a consistent
                  statistical bias on selection. We illustrate how niche
                  construction can generate this evolutionary bias by comparing
                  it with artificial selection. We suggest that it occupies the
                  middle ground between artificial and natural selection. We
                  show how the perspective leads to testable predictions related
                  to: (i) reduced variance in measures of responses to natural
                  selection in the wild; (ii) multiple trait coevolution,
                  including the evolution of sequences of traits and patterns of
                  parallel evolution; and (iii) a positive association between

                  construction provides a cogent and fruitful framework for
                  studying and managing human-environment relationships,
                  including our conceptualizations of them. We first review the
                  development of the ideas of niche construction from
                  evolutionary to social contexts. We then discuss how various
                  human cognitive and affective goals are achieved through our
                  engagement and interaction with the environment, as cognitive
                  and affective niche construction. We extend this analysis to
                  the built environment, as urban niche construction, and
                  provide two examples of urban design for which niche
                  construction provides useful theoretical and practical
                  insights. We also discuss how different urban policy
                  initiatives are related through the lens of cultural niche

                  construction behaviors through time is a key feature of human
                  evolution, culminating in the advanced capacity for ecosystem
                  engineering exhibited by Homo sapiens A crucial outcome of
                  such behaviors has been the dramatic reshaping of the global
                  biosphere, a transformation whose early origins are
                  increasingly apparent from cumulative archaeological and
                  paleoecological datasets. Such data suggest that, by the Late
                  Pleistocene, humans had begun to engage in activities that
                  have led to alterations in the distributions of a vast array
                  of species across most, if not all, taxonomic groups. Changes
                  to biodiversity have included extinctions, extirpations, and
                  shifts in species composition, diversity, and community
                  structure. We outline key examples of these changes,
                  highlighting findings from the study of new datasets, like
                  ancient DNA (aDNA), stable isotopes, and microfossils, as well
                  as the application of new statistical and computational
                  methods to datasets that have accumulated significantly in
                  recent decades. We focus on four major phases that witnessed
                  broad anthropogenic alterations to biodiversity-the Late
                  Pleistocene global human expansion, the Neolithic spread of
                  agriculture, the era of island colonization, and the emergence
                  of early urbanized societies and commercial networks.
                  Archaeological evidence documents millennia of anthropogenic
                  transformations that have created novel ecosystems around the
                  world. This record has implications for ecological and
                  evolutionary research, conservation strategies, and the
                  maintenance of ecosystem services, pointing to a significant
                  need for broader cross-disciplinary engagement between
                  archaeology and the biological and environmental sciences.},

                  evolution, reciprocal to the causal process of natural
                  selection. It works by adding ecological inheritance,
                  comprising the inheritance of natural selection pressures
                  previously modified by niche construction, to genetic
                  inheritance in evolution. Human niche construction modifies
                  selection pressures in environments in ways that affect both
                  human evolution, and the evolution of other species. Human
                  ecological inheritance is exceptionally potent because it
                  includes the social transmission and inheritance of cultural
                  knowledge, and material culture. Human genetic inheritance in
                  combination with human cultural inheritance thus provides a
                  basis for gene-culture coevolution, and multivariate dynamics

                  and theoretical insights for integrating ecosystem ecology and
                  evolutionary theory. We begin by briefly describing NCT, and
                  illustrating how it deifers from conventional evolutionary
                  approaches. We then distinguish between two aspects ofniche
                  construction--environment alteration and subsequent evolution
                  in response to constructed environments--equating the first of
                  these with "ecosystem engineering." We describe some of the
                  ecological and evolutionary impacts on ecosystems of niche
                  construction, ecosystem engineering and ecological
                  inheritance, and illustrate how these processes trigger

                  organisms bring about in ecosystems, NCT helps link ecosystem
                  ecology to evolutionary biology, potentially leading to a

  abstract     = {Recent studies suggest that populations and species often
                  exhibit behavioral syndromes; that is, suites of correlated
                  behaviors across situations. An example is an aggression
                  syndrome where some individuals are more aggressive, whereas
                  others are less aggressive across a range of situations and
                  contexts. The existence of behavioral syndromes focuses the
                  attention of behavioral ecologists on limited (less than
                  optimal) behavioral plasticity and behavioral carryovers
                  across situations, rather than on optimal plasticity in each
                  isolated situation. Behavioral syndromes can explain behaviors
                  that appear strikingly non-adaptive in an isolated context
                  (e.g. inappropriately high activity when predators are
                  present, or excessive sexual cannibalism). Behavioral
                  syndromes can also help to explain the maintenance of
                  individual variation in behavioral types, a phenomenon that is
                  ubiquitous, but often ignored. Recent studies suggest that the
                  behavioral type of an individual, population or species can
                  have important ecological and evolutionary implications,
                  including major effects on species distributions, on the
                  relative tendencies of species to be invasive or to respond
                  well to environmental change, and on speciation rates.
                  Although most studies of behavioral syndromes to date have
                  focused on a few organisms, mainly in the laboratory, further
                  work on other species, particularly in the field, should yield

  abstract     = {Innumerable authors have indicated that new product failure
                  rates have been alarmingly high [3, 10, 11]. With new product
                  development becoming vital to a firm's maintenance or
                  enhancement of its market position, it is increasingly
                  necessary to seek new ways to minimize new product failure.
                  Confrontation of this problem involves developing a more
                  comprehensive understanding of why and how new products are
                  adopted by consumers so that marketing strategy may be more
                  effectively designed and implemented. Research studies
                  attempting to understand the process of new product adoption
                  have been substantial in areas such as rural sociology and the
                  marketing of consumer goods [8, 10, 15, 17]. However,
                  industrial products have received only limited attention.
                  Recent investigations [4, 14, 16, 20] indicate that industrial
                  product buyers may be affected by many of the same variables
                  as the buyers of consumer goods. In these exploratory studies,
                  variables such as perceived risk, self-confidence, seller
                  image, and prior experience were proffered as important
                  factors in the industrial adoption process. Other evidence
                  reported by economists [2, 5, 12] indicates that variables
                  such as the size of the firm and growth rate were relevant to
                  industrial product adoption. To thoroughly understand why and
                  how new industrial products are adopted, it is necessary to
                  include firm variables, such as growth rate and size of firm,
                  as well as individual behavioral variables. Apparently,
                  industrial product research has been limited because
                  cooperation from firms involved in the adoption process of an
                  industrial product is often difficult to obtain, and
                  individual behavioral variables pertinent to the industrial
                  adoption process are frequently difficult to identify and
                  measure. The objective of this exploratory research is to
                  identify the relevant variables needed in this market to
                  provide a better understanding of the adoption process and to
                  establish an information base for future industrial market
                  research in this area.},

                  question remains: Do people high in neuroticism benefit from
                  arts engagement? Using data from two nationally representative
                  panel studies from Germany (N = 874) and Switzerland (N =
                  6,336) we examined whether arts attendance moderates the
                  relation between neuroticism and subjective well-being.
                  Results showed that popular arts attendance moderated the
                  effect of neuroticism on life satisfaction and positive affect
                  in the German sample. Quite similar results were observed in
                  the Swiss sample, where arts attendance acted as a protective
                  factor but only for life satisfaction. Arts attendance,
                  however, did not serve as a moderator of the relation between

                  argued that success is unpredictable, we suggest that
                  period-to-period shifts in sentiment—what we term sentiment
                  volatility—enhance engagement. Automated sentiment analysis of
                  over 4,000 movies demonstrates that more volatile movies are
                  evaluated more positively. Consistent with the notion that
                  sentiment volatility makes experiences more stimulating, the
                  effect is stronger in genres where evaluations are more likely
                  to be driven stimulation (i.e., thrillers rather than
                  romance). Further, analysis of over 30,000 online articles
                  demonstrate that people are more likely to continue reading
                  more volatile articles. By manipulating sentiment volatility
                  in follow-up experiments, we underscore its causal impact on
                  evaluations, and provide evidence for the role of stimulation
                  in these effects. Taken together, the results shed light on

                  completely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, our study aimed
                  to investigate how adolescents spent their leisure time during
                  the Spring 2020 lockdown. Secondly, we aimed to investigate
                  the associations between the perceived changes in leisure time
                  use, the leisure activities adolescents engaged in, and the
                  associations with well-being during the Spring 2020 lockdown
                  in Czechia. METHODS: Data from 3438 participants were included
                  in this study (54.2\% girls; mean age = 13.45, SD = 1.62).
                  First, the initial number of items measuring leisure,
                  electronic media use, and sports was reduced through Principal
                  Component Analysis (PCA). Multivariate linear regression
                  models tested the associations between leisure domains and
                  mental well-being Results: The amount of leisure time,
                  together with socially active leisure and sports and physical
                  activity, formed the strongest positive predictors of mental
                  well-being, whereas idle activities and time spent on
                  electronic media acted as negative predictors. The amount of
                  time spent doing schoolwork was unrelated to mental
                  well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results support the idea
                  that leisure as a promoting factor for well-being is not just
                  a matter of its amount but rather of engagement in meaningful
                  and fulfilling activities.},

                  price when naming reasons why they patronize their favorite
                  stores. Consumers care about variety because they are more
                  likely to find what they want when going to a store that
                  offers more varied assortments. When tastes are not well
                  formed or are dynamic, perceived variety matters even more
                  because of the desire to become educated about what is
                  available while maintaining flexibility. Variety perception
                  also matters when the variety-seeking motive operates.
                  Retailers care about variety because customers value variety.
                  Therefore, it is important to understand how people perceive
                  the variety contained in an assortment and how these
                  perceptions influence satisfaction and store choice.
                  Remarkably, except for a recent study by Broniarczyk et al.
                  (1998), there has been no research aimed at understanding the
                  variety perception process itself. We offer a general
                  mathematical model of variety based on the complete
                  information structure of an assortment, defined both by the
                  multiattribute structure of the objects and their spatial
                  locations. We impose a psychologically plausible set of
                  restrictions on the general model and obtain a class of
                  simpler estimable models of perceived variety. We utilize the
                  model to develop assortments that vary widely in terms of
                  their information structure and study the influence of three
                  factors on variety perceptions: (a) information structure of
                  each assortment (i.e., the attribute level differences between
                  objects); (b) level of organization of the objects and hence
                  their relative spatial positions; and (c) task orientations,
                  promoting either analytic or holistic processing. We also
                  investigate the influence of variety perception and
                  organization on stated satisfaction and store choice. To
                  summarize our major findings: 1. Information structure has a
                  big impact on variety perceptions, though diminishing returns
                  accompany increases in the number of attributes on which
                  object pairs differ. 2. People are more influenced by local
                  information structure (adjacent objects) than nonlocal
                  information structure. Proximity matters. 3. Organization of
                  the display can either increase or decrease variety
                  perceptions. When people engage in analytic processing,
                  organized displays appear to offer more variety. When
                  processing is holistic, random displays are seen as more
                  varied. 4. Both variety perceptions and organization drive
                  stated satisfaction and store choice. People are more
                  satisfied with and likely to choose stores carrying those
                  assortments that are perceived as offering high variety and
                  that are displayed in an organized rather than random manner.
                  Our work provides a basic framework for thinking about
                  variety. By helping retailers to understand the factors that
                  drive variety perception, it may be possible to design more
                  efficient, lower cost assortments without reducing variety
                  perceptions and the probability of future store visits.},

                  Whereas economics derives its predictions from the assumption

                  detrimental effect of presenting options sequentially (one at
                  a time) versus simultaneously (all at once) on choosers'
                  satisfaction with and commitment to their chosen option. This
                  is because choosers presented with their options
                  simultaneously tend to remain focused on the current set of
                  options, comparing them among each other; whereas choosers
                  presented with their options sequentially tend to imagine a
                  better option, hoping it will become available. This feeling
                  of hope undermines how choosers subsequently experience their
                  selected option, resulting in lower satisfaction and
                  commitment levels. Sequential choosers consequently exhibit
                  lower outcome satisfaction regardless of which option they
                  choose, whether sequentially passed-up options remain
                  available, and whether they have equivalent option information
                  to simultaneous choosers. Thus, enjoying the most satisfaction
                  from one's choice might require being willing to give up the
                  eternal quest for the best.},

                  increasingly trying to appeal to consumers’ pursuit of
                  happiness. However, the results of six studies reveal that
                  what happiness means varies, and consumers’ choices reflect
                  those differences. In some cases, happiness is defined as
                  feeling excited, and in other cases, happiness is defined as
                  feeling calm. The type of happiness pursued is determined by
                  one’s temporal focus, such that individuals tend to choose
                  more exciting options when focused on the future, and more
                  calming options when focused on the present moment. These
                  results suggest that the definition of happiness, and
                  consumers’ resulting choices, are dynamic and malleable.},

                  natural to ask whether AI systems can be not only intelligent,
                  but also conscious. I consider why people might think AI could
                  develop consciousness, identifying some biases that lead us
                  astray. I ask what it would take for conscious AI to be a
                  realistic prospect, challenging the assumption that
                  computation provides a sufficient basis for consciousness.
                  I'll instead make the case that consciousness depends on our
                  nature as living organisms - a form of biological naturalism.
                  I lay out a range of scenarios for conscious AI, concluding
                  that real artificial consciousness is unlikely along current
                  trajectories, but becomes more plausible as AI becomes more
                  brain-like and/or life-like. I finish by exploring ethical
                  considerations arising from AI that either is, or convincingly
                  appears to be, conscious. If we sell our minds too cheaply to
                  our machine creations, we not only overestimate them - we

                  While we start knowing more about the proximal mechanisms
                  responsible for the consistent differences in behaviour
                  between individuals in a population, little is known yet about
                  the relationship between the phenotypic distribution of
                  personality traits, or combinations of traits, and fitness.
                  Here we provide an overview of the available literature on the
                  fitness consequences of personality traits in natural
                  populations. We start by a description of two case studies
                  that have examined the role of natural selection on
                  personality traits in the wild (i.e., the great tit, Parus
                  major and bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis), and review other
                  studies that have reported some links between personality
                  traits and fitness indices, in a large variety of animal
                  species. We continue by outlining both direct approaches
                  (i.e., measuring correlational selection on personality trait
                  combinations) and indirect approaches (i.e., comparing
                  correlations between personality traits within and between
                  populations) to study suites of correlated traits from an
                  adaptive perspective. This review, we hope, will be able to
                  stimulate the use of the phenotypic selection analysis applied
                  to the study of selection on personality traits in animals.},

                high-impact tasks in areas such as law enforcement, medicine,
                education, and employment. In order to clarify the intended use
                cases of machine learning models and minimize their usage in
                contexts for which they are not well suited, we recommend that
                released models be accompanied by documentation detailing their
                performance characteristics. In this paper, we propose a
                framework that we call model cards, to encourage such
                transparent model reporting. Model cards are short documents
                accompanying trained machine learning models that provide
                benchmarked evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as
                across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups
                (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type
                [15]) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and
                Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant to the intended
                application domains. Model cards also disclose the context in
                which models are intended to be used, details of the performance
                evaluation procedures, and other relevant information. While we
                focus primarily on human-centered machine learning models in the
                application fields of computer vision and natural language
                processing, this framework can be used to document any trained
                machine learning model. To solidify the concept, we provide
                cards for two supervised models: One trained to detect smiling
                faces in images, and one trained to detect toxic comments in
                text. We propose model cards as a step towards the responsible
                democratization of machine learning and related artificial
                intelligence technology, increasing transparency into how well
                artificial intelligence technology works. We hope this work
                encourages those releasing trained machine learning models to

  abstract     = {AI is undergoing a paradigm shift with the rise of models
                  (e.g., BERT, DALL-E, GPT-3) that are trained on broad data at
                  scale and are adaptable to a wide range of downstream tasks.
                  We call these models foundation models to underscore their
                  critically central yet incomplete character. This report
                  provides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of
                  foundation models, ranging from their capabilities (e.g.,
                  language, vision, robotics, reasoning, human interaction) and
                  technical principles(e.g., model architectures, training
                  procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation, theory) to
                  their applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and
                  societal impact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic and
                  environmental impact, legal and ethical considerations).
                  Though foundation models are based on standard deep learning
                  and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent
                  capabilities,and their effectiveness across so many tasks
                  incentivizes homogenization. Homogenization provides powerful
                  leverage but demands caution, as the defects of the foundation
                  model are inherited by all the adapted models downstream.
                  Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation
                  models, we currently lack a clear understanding of how they
                  work, when they fail, and what they are even capable of due to
                  their emergent properties. To tackle these questions, we
                  believe much of the critical research on foundation models
                  will require deep interdisciplinary collaboration commensurate
                  with their fundamentally sociotechnical nature.},

                  that heritable variation will not be found in important,
                  fitness-relevant characteristics because of the winnowing
                  effect of natural selection. This article propounds the
                  opposite view. Heritable variation is ubiquitous in all
                  species, and there are a number of frameworks for
                  understanding its persistence. The author argues that each of

                  the result of a trade-off between different fitness costs and

                  these trade-offs, it is to be expected that genetic diversity

                  models like ChatGPT in various industries, its potential in
                  the medical domain, especially in standardized examinations,
                  has become a focal point of research. Objective: The aim of
                  this study is to assess the clinical performance of ChatGPT,
                  focusing on its accuracy and reliability in the Chinese
                  National Medical Licensing Examination (CNMLE). Methods: The
                  CNMLE 2022 question set, consisting of 500 single-answer
                  multiple choices questions, were reclassified into 15 medical
                  subspecialties. Each question was tested 8 to 12 times in
                  Chinese on the OpenAI platform from April 24 to May 15, 2023.
                  Three key factors were considered: the version of GPT-3.5 and
                  4.0, the prompt's designation of system roles tailored to
                  medical subspecialties, and repetition for coherence. A
                  passing accuracy threshold was established as 60\%. The χ2
                  tests and κ values were employed to evaluate the model's
                  accuracy and consistency. Results: GPT-4.0 achieved a passing
                  accuracy of 72.7\%, which was significantly higher than that
                  of GPT-3.5 (54\%; P.05). In subgroup analysis, ChatGPT
                  achieved comparable accuracy among different question types
                  (P>.05). GPT-4.0 surpassed the accuracy threshold in 14 of 15
                  subspecialties, while GPT-3.5 did so in 7 of 15 on the first
                  response. Conclusions: GPT-4.0 passed the CNMLE and
                  outperformed GPT-3.5 in key areas such as accuracy,
                  consistency, and medical subspecialty expertise. Adding a
                  system role insignificantly enhanced the model's reliability
                  and answer coherence. GPT-4.0 showed promising potential in
                  medical education and clinical practice, meriting further
                  study.},

                  appropriateness is highly debated in both fields, particularly
                  with regards to whether it is useful for the advancement of
                  science and technology. Considerably less attention, however,
                  has been devoted to how the Computational Metaphor is used

                  concerns over AI's role in perpetuating racism, genderism, and
                  ableism suggest that the term "artificial intelligence" is

                  computational sociologists are developing novel ways to use AI
                  in research. The authors advocate for a third form of
                  sociological engagement with AI: research on how AI can be
                  publicly governed to advance equity in American society. The
                  authors orient sociologists to the rapidly evolving AI policy

                  approaches to AI governance: a safety-based and an
                  equity-based approach. The authors argue that the safety-based
                  approach is the predominant one but is inadequate. They
                  suggest that sociologists can shift AI policymaking to
                  prioritize equity by examining corporate political power in AI

                  objects, which are interdisciplinary objects sustained
                  differently by diverse fields while providing shared
                  discourses between them, this essay summarizes the approaches
                  of examining bias in AI systems. It argues that examining each
                  part related to the building and working of AI systems is
                  essential for unpacking the political play and potential
                  insert points of biases in them. It concentrates on the
                  critical analysis of data and algorithms as two core parts of
                  AI systems by operationalizing hermeneutic reverse
                  engineering. Hermeneutic reverse engineering is a framework to
                  unpack and understand different elements of a technocultural
                  object and/or system that contribute to the construction of
                  its meaning and contexts. It employs a speculative imagination
                  of what other realities can be designed and includes cultural
                  analysis to identify existing meanings and assumptions behind
                  the technocultural object, identifying key elements of
                  signification, and speculating possibilities of reassembling
                  different meanings for the object. The main results obtained
                  by this method on AI systems is using cultural consideration
                  and technological imagination to unpack existing meanings
                  created by AI and design innovative approaches for AI to exert
                  alternate/ inclusive meanings. The research perspectives
                  presented in this article include critical examination of
                  biases and politics within different elements of AI systems,
                  and the impact of these biases on different social groups. The
                  paper proposes using the method of hermeneutic reverse
                  engineering to investigate AI systems and speculate possible
                  alternate and more accountable futures for AI systems.},

                  entailing the knowledge and ability to be accurate. Trust also
                  is essential to communicator credibility. Audiences view
                  trustworthiness as the motivation to be truthful. Identifying
                  whom to trust follows systematic principles. People decide
                  quickly another's apparent intent: Who is friend or foe, on
                  their side or not, or a cooperator or competitor. Those
                  seemingly on their side are deemed warm (friendly,
                  trustworthy). People then decide whether the other is
                  competent to enact those intents. Perception of scientists,
                  like other social perceptions, involves inferring both their
                  apparent intent (warmth) and capability (competence). To
                  illustrate, we polled adults online about typical American
                  jobs, rated as American society views them, on warmth and
                  competence dimensions, as well as relevant emotions.
                  Ambivalently perceived high-competence but low-warmth,
                  "envied" professions included lawyers, chief executive
                  officers, engineers, accountants, scientists, and researchers.
                  Being seen as competent but cold might not seem problematic
                  until one recalls that communicator credibility requires not
                  just status and expertise but also trustworthiness (warmth).
                  Other research indicates the risk from being enviable. Turning
                  to a case study of scientific communication, another online
                  sample of adults described public attitudes toward climate
                  scientists specifically. Although distrust is low, the
                  apparent motive to gain research money is distrusted. The
                  literature on climate science communicators agrees that the
                  public trusts impartiality, not persuasive agendas. Overall,
                  communicator credibility needs to address both expertise and
                  trustworthiness. Scientists have earned audiences' respect,
                  but not necessarily their trust. Discussing, teaching, and
                  sharing information can earn trust to show scientists'
                  trustworthy intentions.},

                  generally suggested that it does, but a recent set of studies
                  by Norton, Frost, and Ariely (2007) challenged that
                  assumption. Instead, they found that more information about
                  another person, when that information was randomly selected
                  from lists of trait adjectives, using a trait evaluation
                  paradigm, promoted perceptions of dissimilarity and, hence,
                  disliking. The present research began with the assumption that
                  natural social interaction involves contexts and processes not
                  present in Norton et al.'s research or in the typical
                  familiarity experiment. We theorized that these processes
                  imply a favorable impact of familiarity on attraction. Two
                  experiments are reported using a live interaction paradigm in
                  which two previously unacquainted same-sex persons interacted
                  with each other for varying amounts of time. Findings strongly
                  supported the "familiarity leads to attraction" hypothesis:
                  The more participants interacted, the more attracted they were
                  to each other. Mediation analyses identified three processes
                  that contribute to this effect: perceived responsiveness,
                  increased comfort and satisfaction during interaction, and
                  perceived knowledge.},

                  exhibiting planning, adaptation, and social dynamics across
                  increasingly diverse, interactive, and open-ended scenarios.
                  These behaviors are not solely the product of the models'
                  internal architecture, but emerge from their integration into
                  agentic systems that operate within situated contexts, where
                  goals, feedback, and interactions shape behavior over time.
                  This shift calls for a new scientific lens: AI Agent
                  Behavioral Science. Rather than focusing only on internal
                  mechanisms, this paradigm emphasizes the systematic
                  observation of behavior, design of interventions to test
                  hypotheses, and theory-guided interpretation of how AI agents
                  act, adapt, and interact over time. We systematize a growing
                  body of research across individual, multi-agent, and
                  human-agent interaction settings, and further demonstrate how
                  this perspective informs responsible AI by treating fairness,
                  safety, interpretability, accountability, and privacy as
                  behavioral properties. By unifying recent findings and laying
                  out future directions, we position AI Agent Behavioral Science
                  as a necessary complement to traditional approaches, providing
                  essential tools for understanding, evaluating, and governing

                  This theory explains key properties of reasoning. When
                  reasoners produce arguments, they are biased and lazy, as can
                  be expected if reasoning is a mechanism that aims at
                  convincing others in interactive contexts. By contrast,
                  reasoners are more objective and demanding when they evaluate
                  arguments provided by others. This fundamental asymmetry
                  between production and evaluation explains the effects of
                  reasoning in different contexts: the more debate and conflict
                  between opinions there is, the more argument evaluation
                  prevails over argument production, resulting in better

                  (DAs) offer benefits, but their downsides can hinder user
                  adoption and limit market potential. Although research exists
                  on users' experiences with DAs, less is known about how user
                  characteristics influence perceptions of a ‘dark
                  side’—perceived creepiness. This study explores how perceived
                  creepiness, user characteristics (uncertainty avoidance), and
                  anxieties triggered by DAs (privacy concerns and technology
                  anxiety) relate to distrust and disengagement from DAs. Based
                  on the stressor‐strain‐outcome and person‐environment fit
                  models, a research model was proposed and tested using survey
                  data from 509 DA users analysed with Amos version 29 software.
                  The results reveal that privacy concerns, uncertainty
                  avoidance, and technology anxiety positively influence
                  perceived creepiness and distrust of DAs, leading to
                  disengagement. Moreover, uncertainty avoidance moderates these
                  relationships, with users higher in uncertainty avoidance
                  experiencing a stronger link between privacy
                  concerns/technology anxiety and perceived creepiness.
                  Importantly, the study shows indirect effects mediated by
                  perceived creepiness, with uncertainty avoidance further
                  moderating these indirect relationships. These findings
                  contribute to literature by highlighting the interplay between
                  user characteristics, DA‐induced anxieties, perceived
                  creepiness, and user disengagement with DAs.},

  abstract     = {ABSTRACTA growing number of retailers and brands use uncertain
                  price promotions to increase their sales. This research
                  introduces the “looking a gift horse in the mouth” effect by
                  probing these promotions as a potential liability. Findings
                  from a field study and five experiments reveal that consumers
                  who receive an inferior prize in an uncertain price promotion
                  have a lower brand appraisal and repeated purchase behavior
                  than those (i) who receive the same prize for sure, (ii) who
                  receive the higher‐value prize in the uncertain promotion, and
                  (iii) who are not even offered any price promotion. We
                  propose, and examine, mixed emotions as a possible reason for
                  this dilution in brand appraisal. The findings offer important
                  insights and managerial implications for practitioners by
                  proposing a revisit of the design of uncertain price
                  promotions to regulate the mood and perception of risky
                  low‐win consumers.},
